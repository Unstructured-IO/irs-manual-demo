However, if Counsel believes a rewrite is needed, the matter should be elevated in Appeals.

No disclosure review will be necessary in these circumstances. b. The prime attorney’s review will encompass not only technical matters, will also include a review of the extent to which the ASG will be made available for public inspection (i.e., that the information contained in the “Settlement Guidelines” section is properly exempt under the FOIA and that the information contained in the other sections may properly be disclosed). The attorney should answer the questions provided on the ASG check sheet to expedite the disclosure review. See Exhibit",
