No item of work may be issued or any action taken until agreement between disputing offices is reached or the matter is resolved though the process of elevation. Because anything signed by or approved in the Chief Counsel’s name should represent the position of the entire office and not merely the position of a par- ticular individual, division, or office, reconciliation of differing views is an important means of ensuring that the views of all Chief Counsel attorneys are adequately considered and the position of the office as a whole is advanced. The reconciliation process helps identify possible errors or omissions in the proposed item of work. The reconciliation process also improves the ability of the Office of Chief Counsel to avoid inconsistent treatment of similarly situated taxpayers and to fulfill its mission to provide the correct legal interpretation of the law.
