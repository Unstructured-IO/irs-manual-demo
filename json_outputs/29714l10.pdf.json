The Docket, Records and User Fee Branch, upon entering the case in the TL CATS system, makes up the legal file by filing the petition and other papers served on the Chief Counsel in the file jacket. One TL CATS generated label is permanently attached to the face of the legal file and the other placed inside the legal file for the field office’s use.

Until the case is formally transferred, the Field group originally assigned the case remains responsible for assuring that all necessary actions (e.g., answering the case) are taken in timely fashion. Because of concern that administrative files may be lost or misplaced if the case is reassigned before retrieval of the administrative file, the Division originally assigned a case should generally answer the case prior to transfer to any group in a different geographic location. At the request or written consent of the transferring organization, however, the case may be transferred prior to answer. The case file and TL CATS/TECHMIS will be ap- propriately annotated to reflect the Division and local office responsibilities respect to the case. (",
