The primary source of information is the administrative file. Even when the ministrative file does not include original tax returns, or a copy of the statutory notice of deficiency or other determination letter, or the originals or copies of other pertinent documents, it usually will contain leads as to the location of such documents. An administrative file also usually contains additional factual information in computer format, including records of electronically filed tax returns, either in printouts or on computer disk or both. Service and Chief Counsel personnel who previously worked on the case or on other litigation, examination, collection, or criminal cases involving the same taxpayer are good sources of information. If their names are not apparent elsewhere in the file, they often can be found by referring to computer information, including updated transcripts of account. (",
