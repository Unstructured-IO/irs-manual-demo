Reductions in grade or rate pay of an employee may be for either disciplinary (conduct) or matters. This would include correction of an erroneous personnel action. An example of a non-disciplinary reduction in grade or pay is reassignment of a wage grade employee to another location having a lower wage schedule for each wage level. An example of a correction to an erroneous personnel is to correct the erroneous placement of an employee by promotion or ment into a position to which the employee is ineligible for promotion or appointment.

If the employee’s defense would be prejudiced by making a response to the proposed action, the Agency should decide an in- definite suspension rather than removal. In that event, the employee would be advised of the indefinite suspension pending adjudication of the criminal actions (presuming the reasons and specifications/evidence sustain such action). Refusal to reply based on the belief that such reply would prejudice the employee’s defense should not delay the action. (",

If it is decided to charge Violet with “Discourteous Conduct with Taxpayers” the evidence must establish that Violet was discourteous to taxpayers. Further, the evidence must establish that the misconduct warrants a suspension of this nature. Examples of the types of evidence needed to prove the charge would be recordings of the telephone conversations between Violet and the taxpayers and/or written statements from the taxpayers regarding Violet’s behavior. The recordings should demonstrate Violet was discourteous to the taxpayer and the Agency’s proposed action is warranted. In addition, there must be evidence such as records/reports that Violet hung up on the taxpayers, if this miscon- duct is cited in the letter.
