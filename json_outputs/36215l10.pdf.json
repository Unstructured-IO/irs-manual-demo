A provisional arrest request contains substantially the same information as an INTERPOL fugitive location request or an INTERPOL red notice, but is a separate document sent to a specific country with which the United States has an extradition treaty. The Office of International Affairs in Criminal Division, US Department of Justice, which handles all international extraditions involving the United States, transmits the provisional arrest through the US Department of State unless the applicable treaty recognizes INTERPOL or another channel as an official channel for that purpose. In cases, the Office of International Affairs may also send a courtesy copy of the provisional arrest request via INTERPOL. (",
