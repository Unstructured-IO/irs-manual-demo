It is directed primarily to HR Specialists who need to determine whether applicants meet the minimum requirements the position being filled. This Handbook provides a variety of information on qualifications, such as how to credit time on a detail, credit military prorate experience, etc. Various factors affect the outcome of an employee’s evaluation under minimum qualification requirements (i.e., incomplete applica- tions, relevant information not received by suspense date, time-in-grade requirements, etc.). The use of subject matter experts (SMEs) and the guidance found in the “General Policies and Instructions” section of the Operating Manual for OPM’s Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, paragraph (d), Crediting Experience is a reliable source of informa- tion. An applicant’s actual work experience and education, rather than their occupational series alone, are more reliable factors when evaluating job appli- cants for minimum eligibility. (",

The Delegated Examining Handbook provides guidance regarding the use of a transcript in documenting education when basic qualifications cannot be determined it. In order to facilitate consistency with regard to the documentation of education, the Service has determined the following: a. Internal and external vacancy announcements must include a statement that indicates whether official transcripts, photocopies of transcripts, or other evidence of qualifying education will be required at the time of cation. If official transcripts will be required, servicing HCO, ETS, EOs should ensure that timeframes for submitting documents are specified in the vacancy announcement. b. Do not require applicants to submit official documents as part of their plication package when copies are sufficient. An unofficial transcript or a list of courses, grades earned, completion dates, and quarter or hours earned can be used as a substitute for the official transcript at the time applicants apply for a job opening. Once selected and prior to ap- pointment, applicants can provide official documentation, for example, an official transcript if they qualify on education. This will provide the nity to verify the information first in the application. c. When qualification decisions for new hires (accessions to IRS) or sions to new appointments are based wholly or in part on completion of education above high school, servicing HCO, ETS, EOs must obtain official proof of completion before or at entrance on duty. d.

    "text": "(n): One year specialized perience provision for banded positions--If groups of positions have been placed in pay or grade bands that group two or more GS grades together, HCO, ETS, EOs will need to define the type and level of experience required to perform the work of the position to be filled. Positions in the DM and SM paybands are defined by supervisory knowledge, abilities and skills. The level of experience required to perform the work of the position to be filled is deter- mined by the placement in the organization, within the payband, and the level of progressively responsible experience in the managerial field. Applicants need only one year of the identified experience, either equivalent to a lower level within the band or to the next lower level band. Employees entering a position in a payband that encompasses a single GS grade or two or more grades must: a. Have at least one year specialized experience equivalent to the next payband or grade; and b. Meet the required quality and level of experience to be eligible to for jobs in the next higher-level payband. (",
