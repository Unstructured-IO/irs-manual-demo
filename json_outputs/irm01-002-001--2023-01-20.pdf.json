Examples of sound causes for delay which, if tablished, will be accepted as reasonable cause are shown below: a. Death or serious illness of the taxpayer or a death or serious illness in his/her immediate family. In the case of a corporation, estate, trust, the death or serious illness must have been of an individual having authority to execute the return or make the deposit or payment or of member of such individual’s immediate family. b. Unavoidable absence of the taxpayer. In the case of a corporation, estate, trust, etc., the absence must have been of an individual having sole authority to execute the return or make the deposit or payment. c. Destruction by ﬁre or other casualty of the taxpayer’s place of business or business records. d. Taxpayer was unable to determine amount of deposit or tax due for reasons beyond the taxpayer’s control. However, this cause will be ac- ceptable for taxpayers required to make deposits or payments of trust fund taxes only when the taxpayer was unable to have access to his/her own records. e. The facts indicate that the taxpayer’s ability to make deposits or payments has been materially impaired by civil disturbances. f. Lack of funds is an acceptable reasonable cause for failure to pay any or make a deposit under the Federal Tax Deposit System only when a taxpayer can demonstrate the lack of funds occurred despite the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence.

Under ordinary circumstances the normal three-year statute may be followed as a guideline. In making determinations as to the extent of retroactivity, District Directors should take into consideration such factors as costs and culties of collection and hardship to taxpayers. A compelling reason for adoption of a relatively long period might be evidence that the taxpayers had some knowledge of their liability but had decided to take no steps to ascertain their exact liability, or the responsibility of the collecting agency to collect from them. Considerations which might justify a relatively short period are a case where liability depends upon an unusually narrow or difficult point of interpreta- tion under which the taxpayers may have had a reasonable basis for doubting their liability for tax, and a case where misleading or incorrect advice was given to the taxpayers by an employee of the Internal Revenue Service.",

Under ordinary circumstances the normal three-year statute may be followed as a guideline. In making determinations as to the extent of retroactivity, District Directors should take into consideration such factors as costs and diffi- culties of collection and hardship to taxpayers. A compelling reason for adoption of a relatively long period might be evidence that the taxpayers had some knowledge of their liability but had decided to take no steps to ascertain their exact liability, or the responsibility of the collecting agency to collect from them. Considerations which might justify a relatively short period are a case where liability depends upon an unusually narrow or difficult point of interpreta- tion under which the taxpayers may have had a reasonable basis for doubting their liability for tax, and a case where misleading or incorrect advice was given to the taxpayers by an employee of the Internal Revenue Service.",

Such activities are an effective way to inform and educate the public about the Service’s mission and operations and to help taxpayers understand their rights and obligations. Generally, invitations to speak, write for publication or otherwise participate in contacts with outside groups should be accepted where the invitation offers an opportunity to meet the goals of informing and educating the public. Each request should be considered on its own merit. However, such activities must not interfere with the primary duties of the officials and employees involved. Service personnel should not participate in meetings, seminars, tax forums, etc.; which appear to be sponsored principally for proﬁtmaking purposes, regardless of whether the sponsor is a taxable business or a tax exempt organization. However, exceptions can be made when it is determined that participating is appropriate because it is the most effective and efficient way to promote the Service’s mission and to further public education. An invitation to speak to any group should not be accepted where the evident purpose or probable result of the meeting may be to indicate that the sponsor has a preferential relationship with the Internal Revenue Service; where it might appear that information not available to others is being provided to a preferred group; or where it appears that the speaker’s official position with the Service is being used primarily to foster a private purpose rather than to promote the objective of informing and educating the public. Requests for participation in conferences or seminars sponsored by other gov- ernment agencies or members of Congress will be afforded the same consideration as other requests. (",

Thus, it is particularly important in those cases for examiners and their managers to consider the potential applicability of penalties, and to develop fully the facts to either support the application of penalty or to demonstrate that penalties should not apply. Consistent develop- ment and proper application of the accuracy-related and fraud penalties in abusive transaction cases will help curb this activity by imposing tangible economic consequences on taxpayers who engage in those transactions. In addition, consistent development and proper application of the promoter and preparer penalties in abusive transaction cases will help curb this activity by providing an economic deterrent for promoting abusive transactions and preparing returns claiming tax beneﬁts from abusive transactions. An abusive transaction is one where a signiﬁcant purpose of the transaction is the avoidance or evasion of Federal tax. (",
