Internal controls are processes, both trative and program speciﬁc, that ensure programs achieve their intended results and organizations realize their goals. Internal controls ensure that ﬁnancial and management reports are accurate, complete, and timely. Managers assess risks (for example, the probability of a negative, unantici- pated occurrence) of operations, determine if controls do not mitigate those risks and certify that those controls are effective. If managers identify weak- nesses in their internal control procedures, they are required to report them the responsible officials and business unit leadership so that a corrective plan can be developed and implemented.
