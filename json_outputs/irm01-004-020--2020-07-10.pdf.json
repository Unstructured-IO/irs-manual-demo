This allows any taxpayer contact, whether face-to-face, by phone, by correspondence is documented and accessible by any IRS employee re- sponding to taxpayer inquiries and working taxpayer compliance issues. Unique to AMS is the ability for any user to leave detailed case history narra- tives. This allows information to be shared across multiple functions working the taxpayer’s account. The enhanced efficiency of the “One Stop” concept of customer service reduces the length of time in which taxpayer inquiries are handled and reduces the time frame in which enforcement activities are conducted. Frontline employees have access to more complete information, enabling them to better respond to taxpayer inquiries, address all issues, and provide resolution. This reduces the need for subsequent taxpayer contact or correspondence on the same issue. In addition, the ability to enhance customer service ties directly to the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of taxpayers with the IRS, which in turn inﬂuences taxpayer compliance. (",
