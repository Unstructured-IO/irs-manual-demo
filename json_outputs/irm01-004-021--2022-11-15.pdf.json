    "text": "a. Peripheral Gateway (PG) : This is the part of the infrastructure perform- ing distribution of taxpayer calls between resources (Agents and VRUs) within a call center. The call distribution process is interactive with a caller and driven by information provided by a caller via a telephone dial pad. Before the caller can reach a particular peripheral gateway, a call is routed nation-wide by the ICM system. Peripheral Gateways are special- ized servers that connect the call center to other call center resources. b. Computer Telephone Integration (CTI, VRU) : This segment represents a special purpose infrastructure built to provide integration between telephone-voice technology and computer-based applications. It includes platforms incorporating two types of interfaces and translation between them: telephone interfaces, communicating analog voice and telephone signaling, and computer interfaces, communicating digital data. CTI platforms, sometimes called Voice Response Units (VRU) or Interactive Voice Response (IVR), are deployed in the CCE to support such telephone-based applications as TRIS/ICCE. These platforms collect the necessary information to direct the caller to the appropriate resource. The Internet Service Node (ISN), a web-based platform, will collect caller in- formation to determine the skill needed to handle the issue. This platform performs Prompt/Collect, Queuing, and Call Control services for Contact Centers and self-service IVR applications. The accumulation of telephone calls will be placed in a queue until delivery can be initiated to a resource like a phone representative. The prompter communicates with the Intelli- gent Contact Management (ICM) to understand the correct place to send a call. The Enterprise Queue (EQ) allows work types (e.g., calls, paper correspondence, email) to be treated as if they are part of single, large enterprise queues. In this manner the ICM platform can look at all IRS resources across the enterprise, as if they were part of a single, large agent pool for a single application. Calls are queued at the national level for distribution to the next available resource at any call site. c. Intelligent Call Manager (ICM) : ICM is one component of the Contact Center Environment (CCE) that provides skill and status based call routing between multiple IRS Call Centers. It monitors real-time status and availability of Peripheral Gateways, Voice Response Units (VRU) and Agents (Customer Service / Collection Representatives) at all the Call Centers and directs Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) Service Provider (Verizon) to route a call to a particular destination. Such real- time call management is performed based on a dedicated ICM’s server- network infrastructure, which is comprised of central ICM servers (at two locations: Enterprise Computing Center at Martinsburg (ECC-MTB) and Enterprise Tennessee Computing Center at Memphis (ECC-MEM)) and peripheral ICM servers at the call centers. d. Customer Voice Portal (CVP) : CVP is also referred to as: Customer Voice Portal-Enterprise Queuing (CVP-EQ) and Internet Service Node (ISN)/Customer Voice Portal (CVP). CVP is a web-based platform that provides for Prompt/Collect, Enterprise Queuing, and Call Control services for contact centers and self-service Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application. It allows the Contact Center Environment (CCE) to become a multi-channel contact center (instead of a call-only center). Customer Voice Portal-Enterprise Queuing allows calls to queue in a central network location instead of at the individual call sites. The call is in queue for every agent group in the enterprise that can handle it. Queuing calls at an enterprise level is a more efficient use of resources since it prevents calls from being “stuck” at one site, while there are",

In the e−mail include the KISAM ticket information, the call center phone MAC address, and the cube number where the phone is located. If the call center phone MAC address is conﬁgured correctly in the call center manager, then the phone needs to be replaced.
