These factors can drive the overall satisfaction and conﬁdence/trust with the program, agency and the government at large. e. Customer satisfaction measure - An indicator of the level of overall sat- isfaction with service provided by the IRS as perceived by internal and external customers. f. Cycle time -The total time from the beginning to the end of a process, as deﬁned by the business operating division within the IRS. g. Data Dictionary - Document which describes a performance measure in detail, including formal deﬁnition, responsible official, data source, data reliability and program controls. h. Diagnostic tools and/or workload indicator - Indicators used to discover the factors affecting changes in the balanced measures. i. Efficiency measures - Capture the operation’s skillfulness in executing programs, implementing activities and achieving results, while avoiding wasted resources, effort, time and/or money. Efficiency is the ratio of the outcome or output to the input of any program. j. Indicators - A measurable value used to interpret agency progress or monitor external factors that may affect progress. They do not have targets due to a lack of historical values for comparison or a lesser degree of control over the measurable value. They are usually used for new measures. k. IRS balanced measures - Indicators of organizational performance for customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results. l. Outcome measures - Describe the intended result from carrying out a program or activity. Deﬁne an event or condition external to the program or activity that is directly important to the intended beneﬁciaries and/or the public. m. Outcome neutral - Production or resource data that do not contain infor- mation regarding the tax enforcement result reached in any case, such as the number of cases closed, level of service provided and assistance and outreach efforts undertaken. n. Output measures - Describe the level of activity that will be provided over a time period, including a description of the characteristics established as standards for the activity, such as timeliness. o. Overage - An excess or surplus of resources. p. Performance budget - A budget that links performance goals with costs for achieving a target level of performance. A performance budget links strategic goals with related long-term and annual performance goals (outcomes) to the costs of speciﬁc activities to inﬂuence these outcomes.

The following is a quick reference for the IRS balanced performance measure- ment system. a. The IRS must carefully consider each of the three components of balanced measures - customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results - when setting organizational objectives, establishing goals, assessing progress and results, and evaluating individual perfor- mance. b. Under the IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System, the approved set of balanced measures is the primary means for assessing organizational performance. The IRS can use other information and data for purposes such as workload planning and analysis. c. Each measure should have targets based on the previous year’s results, historical patterns and the anticipated mix of resources available; the linkage to organizational priorities and initiatives, planned process im- provements or system enhancements and an assessment of existing and emerging trends, issues and problems. New measures may be catego- rized as indicators when initially created in the absence of historical data or when there’s a lessened degree of control over the measurable value. Targets are not required for indicators. d. Targets set for quantity business results must always consider the effects on customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and quality. The IRS may use quantity measures to evaluate and/or set or suggest goals for organi- zational units at levels that do not measure customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction or quality, if such measures exist at a higher level in the organization. e. The IRS should not use the performance of any one unit as a standard by which the performance of other units are evaluated because of differ- ences in the types of taxpayers served, speciﬁc tax issues addressed and other factors. However, some measures at the Servicewide level may combine aspects of multiple business units into one measure. In these cases, individual business units should track their own performance separately from the combined measure.",
