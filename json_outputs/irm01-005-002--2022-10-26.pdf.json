Therefore, making determinations of reasonable cause or due diligence for penalty abatement or waiver is a Section 1204 activity. In other instances, taxpayers will respond to penalty notices by presenting new facts indicating that the penalty does not apply. Other penalty abatements arise due to adjustments to the underlying tax on which they are computed.
