Informing an employee that they may apply for or otherwise compete for a position does not satisfy the obligation of appropriate officials to review vacancies for positions which the employee is qualiﬁed. Appropriate officials should determine if there is another position at the same or lower grade which the employee can perform.

Agencies are responsible for determining how to document volunteer service (e.g., self-developed forms, letters, etc.). An SF-50 can not be used to document volunteer appointments; however, agencies must clearly inform volunteers of the nature of their appointment with respect to service credit for leave or other employee beneﬁts.” For guidance on recommended language to use for documenting volunteer service, go to Chapter 33 of OPM’s GPPA: http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/Gppa33.pdf",
