The IRS has 180 days from the issuance of the ﬁnal audit report to respond to Congress with the detailed corrective actions to be taken and time frames within which they will be implemented to carry out the recommen- dation(s). Note: The 180-Day Letter process was formerly referred to as the 60 Day Letter process. However, the Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act (P.L. 115-414; January 3, 2019) amended 31 USC 720(b) to increase the timeframe to 180 days. A6 Audit Summary Report A report generated from JAMES is used to verify information entered into JAMES. The report contains a summary of ﬁndings, recommendations and PCAs, including the amount of any potential monetary beneﬁts and root cause. Generally, the infor- mation in this report, for TIGTA audits, is entered into JAMES by TIGTA. EAM enters relevant data from the GAO ﬁnal reports for GAO recommendations and their corresponding corrective actions. Agreement to Facts (ATF) A document issued by TIGTA after ﬁeldwork has been conducted but before any report drafts have been produced. This document represents statements about IRS programs or processes that TIGTA audited and believes to be factually accurate based on their ﬁeldwork and research.

Audit is interchangeable or synonymous with review. Audit Liaison Business unit single point of contact responsible for audit activity within that particular business unit.

Supporting evidentiary documentation accompanying a request to close PCA should describe the work that the business unit performed to plan and execute corrective actions. For example, it is insufficient to state a system upgrade was completed; the documentation should show how and when it was completed, and what actions were performed (e.g., migrate to new servers, purchase additional software, etc.) to complete the PCA. b. PCA outputs should be available as supporting documentation, e.g., if a PCA speciﬁes that a training plan will be completed, the ﬁnal training should be provided as documentation. c. Business units should also provide materials that support the process used to complete a PCA. Continuing the training plan example, if a business unit used a survey or other tool to evaluate training needs, a copy of that survey or tool may be included as supporting d. The results of objective, data-driven analyses used in the creation and execution of a PCA may be included as supporting documentation. e. Proof that required actions were taken should be included. For example, if a population of employees was supposed to complete a training course, evidence that they all completed the course by a certain date should be included. Similarly, if organizations had to review and certify that security requirements are in place, documentation of that self- certiﬁcation should be provided. f. Documentation of purchases, resource reallocations, or other required ﬁnancial activities should be provided. Examples may include completed purchase orders, funding realignment reports from the Integrated Financial System, or proof of receipt and acceptance. g. If new controls have been implemented as a result of the corrective action, and if the controls have been tested to demonstrate they are effective, documentation such as test plans and/or results of that testing may be provided as supporting material as well. h. EAM will consider other potential criteria and sources of documentation not listed here if appropriate to the situation. See Exhibit",

The team assessed current skill levels through a survey that was distributed to all ABC technical employees and targeted interviews of employees within several key job classiﬁcations. The team worked with senior ABC lead- ership to identify short and long-term goals and the critical skills needed to be able to meet these goals. The team then compared the current skill levels with the critical skills identiﬁed by senior leadership to determine the skill gap. The outcome of this study revealed that, within the ABC Business Unit workforce, there is an inad- equate number of employees designated as advanced Subject Matter Experts (SME).",
