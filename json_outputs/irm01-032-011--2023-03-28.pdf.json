If employees owe a delinquent debt to a federal or state agency and that agency refers the debt to Treasury, then Treasury will offset any federal payment due to the employee to enforce collection of the delin- quent debt. Federal payments eligible for offset include the employee’s federal salary, travel advances and reimbursements, tax refunds, and federal retire- ment payments. If the advance is offset by TOP, the employee must pay back the travel advance when ﬁling the voucher. (",
