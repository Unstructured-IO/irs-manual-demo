The Employee Suggestion Program (ESP) is a servicewide program, and the policy, procedures, and guidelines for the program can be found on the ESP website (http://esp.web.irs.gov/). Therefore, Wage and Investment (W&I) no longer requires an IRM specific for W&I employees. A Servicewide ESP Training Guide Handbook has been established and to all W&I ESP Coordinators, and it is also available on the ESP website.",
