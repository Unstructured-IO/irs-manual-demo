    "text": ") Risk Management is the identiﬁcation, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities. • Risk identiﬁcation allows individuals to identify risks so that the project team becomes aware of potential problems. Not only should risk cation be undertaken as early as possible, but it also should be repeated frequently. • Risk analysis transforms the estimates or data about speciﬁc risks that developed during risk identiﬁcation into a consistent form that can be used to make decisions around prioritization. Risk analysis enables stakeholders to commit resources to manage the most important risks. • Risk validation takes the information obtained from risk analysis and uses it to formulate strategies, plans, change requests, and actions. Risk validation ensures that these plans are approved and then incorpo- rated into the standard day-to-day processes and infrastructure. • Risk control and mitigation is the process of executing risk action plans and their associated status reporting; the development of mitigation plans designed to manage, eliminate, or reduce risk to an acceptable level. Risk control and mitigation also includes monitoring risks, identify- ing new risks, prioritizing mitigation alternatives, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. This requires that detailed descriptions of the risk mitigation plans, mitigation activities, and closure rationale are captured, and closure documentation is entered into the ITRAC for all IT organization program and projects risks, as applicable. • Risk tracking monitors the status of speciﬁc risks and the progress in their respective action plans. Risk tracking also includes monitoring the probability, impact, exposure, and other measures of risk for changes that could alter priority or risk plans and ultimately the availability of the service. Risk reporting ensures that the operations staff, service manager, and other stakeholders are aware of the status of top risks and the plans to manage them. Each program or project is required to conduct periodic reviews of the risk descriptions and documentation entered into the ITRAC to ensure that the information is appropriate, current, complete, and accurate.",
