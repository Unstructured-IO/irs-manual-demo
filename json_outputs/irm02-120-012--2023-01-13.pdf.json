The process will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to support the business require- ments of the enterprise. The process will be designed and developed based on ROI to the business. Process metrics will be focused on providing relevant information as opposed to merely presenting raw data. People : Statement: Roles and responsibilities for the process must be clearly deﬁned and appropriately staffed with people having the required skills and training.

No blanks are permitted. • The ﬁrst character of the data name must be alpha- betic (A-Z). • Data names may not start with verbs • The maximum length of a name (including special characters) is 30 characters. • Each name must be unique • Each name must be clear and accurate to reﬂect a condensed version of the data description. • Abbreviate only when it is necessary to reduce a name to 30 characters or less. • Effective with this transmit- tal, names in COBOL applications will not contain abbreviations for words of four characters or less. • Each name must contain a class word. A class word speciﬁes the nature of the data and must be the right- most word in the name (e.g., TAXPAYER-BIRTH-DATE). The EDSG (Enterprise Data Standards and Guidelines) provides a list of Standard class words.

This description should be retained as a part of the data dictionary entry. • A close relationship must exist between a data name and its description; one should reﬂect the other. A general or broad description requires a general name. • Do not use the source or destination of the entity. Avoid: This entry comes from previous Run to next Run (for instance from Run 123 to Run 456. • Do not specify the process- ing done on the entity, Avoid: This amount is the result of price times quantity. • Attach system/function names or form numbers to data items only when the description limits its use to a particular function.
