The Change Management process will have a single Process Owner and a separate Process Manager, responsible for implementation and ensuring adherence to the process. The process will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to support the business requirements of the enterprise. Process metrics will be focused on providing relevant information as opposed to merely presenting raw b. People. Roles and responsibilities for the process must be clearly deﬁned and appropriately staffed with people having the required skills and training. The mission, goals, scope and importance of the process must be clearly and regularly communicated by upper management to the staff and business customers of IT. All IT staff (direct and indirect users of the process) shall be trained at the appropriate level to enable them to support the process. It is imperative that people working in, sup- porting or interacting with the process in any manner understand what they are supposed to do. Without that understanding, Change Manage- ment will not be successful. c. Process. Modiﬁcations to the Change Management process must be approved by the Process Owner. The design of the process must include appropriate interfaces with other processes to facilitate data sharing, es- calation and workﬂow. The process must be capable of providing data to support real-time requirements as well as historical/trending data for overall process improvement initiatives. The process must be fully docu- mented, published and accessible to the various stakeholders of the process. The process will be reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure it continues to support organizational goals and objectives (continuous im- provement). The process must include Inputs, Outputs, Controls, Activities, Tasks, Roles and Responsibilities, Tool and Data requirements along with documented process ﬂows. The process will be kept straight forward, rational, and easy to understand. The process must meet tional and business requirements. d. Technology and Tools All tools selected must conform to the enterprise architectural standards and direction. Existing in-house tools and ogy will be used wherever possible, new tools will only be entertained if they satisfy a business need that cannot be met by current in-house tools. The selection of supporting tools must be process driven and based on the requirements of the business. Selected tools must provide ease of deployment, customization and use. Automated workﬂow, notiﬁ- cation and escalation will be deployed wherever possible to minimize delays, ensure consistency, reduce manual intervention and ensure ap- propriate parties are made aware of issues requiring their attention. Technology and tools should be used to augment the process capabili- ties, not become an end themselves.",
