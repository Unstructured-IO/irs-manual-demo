The beneﬁts of this regular review approach are that, sometimes, enhanced levels of availability may be achievable, but with much lower costs. The optimization approach is a sensible ﬁrst step to delivering better value for money. A number of availability management techniques can be applied to identify optimization opportunities. It is recommended that the scope should be restricted to the technology, but also include a review of both the business process and other end-to-end business owned responsibilities. To help these aims, availability management needs to be recognized as a leading inﬂuence over the IT service provider organization to ensure continued focus on availability and stability of the technology.",
