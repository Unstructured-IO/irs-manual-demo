SB/SE Review of Program Operation and Performance - Results of audits are reviewed in SB/SE CCS as directed by the Program manager. Reviews are performed to gauge program effectiveness and Examiner adherence to IRM procedures. Results are shared with SB/SE CCS agement and, as appropriate, can be referred to SB/SE Examination Policy for issuance of alerts, feedback for training, or IRM revisions. tionally, system reviews are conducted to ensure case selection systems, such as DEBR are performing as prescribed in the system documenta- tion. These reviews are typically done by the analyst with oversight of rule creation/revisions. Resolving or mitigating any defects found is a ordinated effort between the CWI analyst and the respective systems analyst(s) or coordinator. Documentation of these reviews, including cor- rective action taken, is provided to the SB/SE CCS Program Manager signature and retained. b.

The schedule and sample size, including any supplemental or follow-up reviews, is determined by the SB/SE CCS Program Manager. CWI Analysts are required to prepare an activity record for each group of cases delivered to the campus inventories. The activity record contains: • The volume of potential cases that met pre-established ﬁlters. • The research and ﬁltering actions taken on that pool of cases, along with which CCS/CWI function took the action. • Activity dates and volumes remaining in the pool at each stage of the selection process. • Hyperlinks to the data ﬁles that contain the considered cases and their relevant research results.

The review documents, including actions taken to remediate defects found, are submitted to the SB/SE CCS Program Manager for signature. Signed reviews are maintained by CCS. d. Reviews of survey determinations in CCS - CCS typically classiﬁes more inventory than is called for in the annual start plan to ensure that there are sufficient cases available to meet the plan and provide ﬂexibility should a plan change occur. This can result in excess inventory at the end of the plan period. This excess inventory is closed as non-examined, also known as surveyed. As directed by the SB/SE CCS Program Manager, the CWI Supervisory Tax Analyst, or other managerial designee (hereafter referred to as the reviewer), conducts reviews of surveyed cases. The review of surveys is conducted on an as-needed basis, i.e., when there is a need to bulk-survey cases. This is typically after the close of the annual start plan period. At the direction of the CWI Manager, a periodic review is performed to determine if there is a need to purge the systems of unstarted, unneeded inventory. This review contains but is not limited to the project code(s), volume, tax year(s) and campus assignment of the inventory being proposed as “excess”. The proposal to survey is then provided to the designated reviewer. The CWI Manager or CCS Program Manager will approve the survey of excess inventory and maintain recordation. Note: The process of surveying inventory at the CCS level is not to be confused with determining to survey individual cases in the campuses.
