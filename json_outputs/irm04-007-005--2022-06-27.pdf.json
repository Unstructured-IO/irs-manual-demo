    "text": "requesting AIMS freeze codes to be set or released and re- establishment for closed AIMS cases are not processed in the group, but forwarded to either Planning and Special Programs (PSP) or the A/E staff input, following local procedures. It is recommended that managers access ERCS at least every two days to check for updates pending managerial approval. When a manager logs into ERCS a message is displayed if there are requisitions or updates that approval. All requisitions with time charges must be approved or disapproved prior to end of each reporting cycle. When a requisition with time applied is disap- proved, the time is moved to a below the line activity code. If disapproved the time applied is transmitted in the SETTS ﬁle, corrections cannot be and hours will be inﬂated on the tables. The manager should review cases prior to closure on ERCS. After the is complete, cases should be closed and approved on ERCS. Once the code update is reﬂected on AIMS the cases should be shipped to the function within three business days. Normally updates to returns on ERCS requiring approval are performed by administrative support staff and approved by the manager. However, if a manager or temporary acting manager updates a return, the action may require the TM to approve the work. When an update is pending approval, many ERCS screens and reports a “p” next to the item to denote the update is “pending”. When an update is approved or disapproved, the “p” is removed. For detailed information about the Managerial Approval program, options screens, see the Managerial Approval chapter of the ERCS Group for Group and Team Managers and the Managerial Approval chapter of the ERCS Territory Handbook for TMs.",

For more information about how codes are used for employee audit security see the Security chapter of the ERCS Technical Reference Manual. ERCS users must have a login name on their employee record. The login name is used to verify a user has permission to access ERCS and in the creation of the audit trails. Employees who ﬁll in for their managers are temporary ERCS access and assigned a login. The login name should not removed from the ERCS employee record when the assignment is complete, since audit trails may have been created during the employee’s assignment. The WSP contains the employee’s tour of duty (TOD) information and the number of hours the employee is scheduled to work each day. This is used when time is input for the employee on ERCS. Each technical employee, manager, and the territory managers in LB&I must account for the number of hours they are scheduled to work each day. The WSP is also to determine when an employee is required to charge holiday time on When entering the WSP the user must enter their employment type, full time or part time, and TOD. Part time employees default to enter hours for the TIme TOD, full time employees can be under one of ﬁve possible TODs. following are the six choices for the TOD:",

Some codes are nationally deﬁned and some are available for local deﬁnition. When an action code is input on a return, a purge date is either set by the ERCS program or input by the user. Action Codes 01 and 02 also require an appointment time to be input by the user.",
