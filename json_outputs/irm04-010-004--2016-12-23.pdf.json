Bank records were used to reconstruct the taxpayer’s business receipts and expenses. Because the bank records reﬂected virtually no personal expenditures, BLS cost-of-living data was used to determine income attributable to some other untraced source from which personal expenses were paid in addition to the reconstructed gross business receipts. The Court sustained the use of BLS data under these circumstances, except where the BLS ﬁgures appeared to be duplications of expenses paid from the bank accounts. (",

The taxpayer did not comply with, and objected to, administrative summonses, but the examiner did not seek enforcement. The notice of deﬁciency reﬂected unre- ported income determined using prior year reported earnings adjusted by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Court held this determination of unreported income to be arbitrary and erroneous. Some predicate (preexisting) evidence establishing income was necessary to support a determination of unreported income.",

Bank records were used to reconstruct the taxpayer’s business receipts and expenses. Because the bank records reﬂected virtually no personal expenditures, BLS cost-of-living data was used to determine income attributable to some other untraced source from which personal expenses were paid in addition to the reconstructed gross business receipts.

    "text": "Duplicated items include checks to cash where the proceeds are redepos- ited. An example is when the taxpayer writes a check payable to cash and obtains currency and/or coins from the bank in exchange for the check. This currency is then used to cash customers’ checks, which are deposited into the taxpayer’s bank account; in effect, redepositing the funds withdrawn. This deposit must be eliminated in determining deposits from taxable receipts. Transfers between accounts are another example of nontaxable receipts. Transfers can occur between different checking accounts, different savings accounts, and between savings accounts and checking accounts. Such transfers do not represent additional receipts since they are merely a shifting of funds from one account to another. Deposits from transfers must be eliminated in determining deposits from taxable receipts. Loan proceeds should be documented with loan applications and records of disbursement. The documents should be reviewed to conﬁrm the amount and terms of the loan and determine if the information supplied by the taxpayer on the loan application is consistent with information on the return. Differences should be reconciled and may result in the identiﬁcation of additional sources of income. Other common types of nontaxable receipts that are often deposited and must be eliminated in determining deposits from taxable receipts include gifts, inheritances, nontaxable Social Security beneﬁts, nontaxable Veterans Administration beneﬁts, tax refunds, etc.",

    "text": ") Bank Deposits and Cash Expenditures Method — Most challenges to the accuracy of this method focus on the nature of the individual deposits in the account(s). The taxpayer may claim that the deposits consist of taxable and nontaxable items that were not correctly classiﬁed by the examiner. loan proceeds, gifts and inheritances, as well as transfers from other are some of the most common claims. Redeposits of items, such as funds checks, may also cause inaccuracy if counted twice. The examiner should carefully review the analysis and attempt to identify the source and character of each deposit before presenting results as an understatement of taxable income. (",

Usually direct corroborating evidence is available, but statements made about the source and use of the funds can be veriﬁed. Look for inconsistencies. For example: a. The taxpayer may not have had sufficient taxable or nontaxable income prior years to accumulate cash. b. Taxpayer claims of substantial cash-on-hand or accumulated funds be discredited by showing that the taxpayer borrowed money, made in- stallment purchases, incurred large debts, was delinquent on accounts, had a poor credit rating, or ﬁled for bankruptcy. Demonstrating that the taxpayer lived sparingly may suggest that the taxpayer does not have cumulated funds, but showing that the taxpayer lived sparingly does necessarily discredit a taxpayer’s assertion that they had substantial mulated funds. Cultural differences and individual philosophies money management may explain the taxpayer’s chosen lifestyle. c.
