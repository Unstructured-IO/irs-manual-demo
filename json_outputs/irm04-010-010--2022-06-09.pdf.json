Alimony and separate maintenance payments are excluded from income and are not deductible for divorce or separate maintenance agree- ments executed after December 31, 2018. 3023 Alimony income/ deduction for agreements revised after 12/31/2018 We adjusted your alimony income or deduction because your divorce or separate maintenance agreement was revised after December 31, 2018.

Since your loss is not a casualty, it is not deductible. 3303 Deductible only in year occurred Your casualty loss is deductible only in the taxable year in which the casualty occurred. Since your casualty loss did not occur in the taxable year you claimed the deduction, and did not occur in a Federally declared disaster area, we have disallowed it. 3304 Insect attach-shrubs Since the trees, shrubs, etc., on your property were damaged or destroyed by disease instead of by a casualty, you cannot deduct their value as a casualty loss. 3305 Moth/termite damage The cost of repairing termite or moth damage is not deductible as a casualty loss. 3306 Deterioration not a casualty Normal progressive deterioration is not deductible as a casualty loss. 3307 Indirect related expenses not a part of casualty Expenses indirectly connected with a casualty, such as the cost of care for personal injuries, fuel, moving, or rental of temporary quarters, are not deductible as casualty losses. 3308 Insurance proceeds reduce loss Insurance proceeds or any other recovery received, or expected to be received, reduce your casualty or theft loss deduction. 3309 Casualty loss/disaster area Since you have a casualty loss in a Federally declared disaster area, you can deduct the loss on your return for the year imme- diately preceding the year in which the disaster occurred.

For tax years 2018 through 2025, miscellaneous deductions that are subject to the 2 percent adjusted gross income limitation are not deduct- ible. Office-in-the-home expense is subject to the 2 percent adjusted gross income limitation, so it is not deductible. 4901 Excess loss denied Passive losses and credits can be offset by passive income (or in the case of credits, to the tax attributable to net passive income). Passive losses are also allowed to the extent they qualify for the special allowance for rental real estate activities. They cannot be used to offset portfolio income. Since your losses from such activities were in excess of the passive income and the special allowance, the excess loss has been denied. You may carry forward the amount of the loss you were unable to claim. 4902 Passive activity deﬁned Passive losses can only be offset against passive income. A passive activity is one involving the conduct of a trade or business in which you do not materially participate, or any rental activity unless the requirements of IRC 469(c)(7) are met in tax years beginning after December 31, 1993. 4903 Rental activity/IRC 469(c)(7) Rental activities of any kind, regardless of material participation, are considered passive activities unless the requirements of IRC 469(c)(7) are met in tax years beginning after December 31, 1993. 4904 Partnerships and S cor- porations Passive losses and credits include those passed through to partners and shareholders by partnerships and S corporations from activities that are passive to the taxpayer. 4905 Passive loss can be carried forward indeﬁ- nitely Although your loss and/or credit from a passive activity has been denied, it may be carried forward indeﬁnitely. 4906 Mortgage interest expense/IRC 469(j)(7) Under IRC 469(j)(7), Passive Activity Loss of a taxpayer shall be computed without regard to qualiﬁed residence interest.

Because your net loss from these activities was under the limitation, your expenses have been allowed as veriﬁed. 5012 Net operating losses You did not have enough nonpassive income (within the tion) to absorb the net losses from the rental activities in you actively participated. Your otherwise allowable losses therefore treated as losses which are not from a passive and are treated as net operating losses which will be carried back and forward in accordance with the rules applicable to operating losses.

These costs are capitalized by adding them to your basis in the asset. 5909 Legal expenses allowed You are allowed an additional deduction for legal expenses. 6001 Depletion-cost-general Under the cost method of depletion, each unit of production sold is assigned a part of the cost or other basis of the interest. This is determined by dividing the cost or other basis by the total units expected to be recovered. We reﬁgured your depletion ac- cordingly. 6002 Depletion- percent depletion-general Under the percentage or statutory method of ﬁguring depletion, the law provides a special percentage factor for different types of minerals and other natural resources. This percentage is multi- plied by the gross income from the interest to arrive at the depletion allowance. We reﬁgured your depletion allowance ac- cordingly. 6003 Depletion - percent depletion-oil and gas limitations Under the percentage depletion method a ﬂat percentage of the gross income from the property is taken as the depletion deduction. For oil and gas wells, the deduction allowed by the IRC 613A is the lesser of (a) the ﬂat percentage of gross income from the property (b) 100 percent of the “Taxable Income” from the property, or (c) 65 percent of the taxable income on the entire tax return. We have recomputed your depletion allowance as shown in the attached computation. 6004 Depletion - percent depletion oil and gas limit allowed only on oil prod. The law allows percentage depletion only on oil and gas actually produced and sold under the taxpayer’s normal method of ac- counting or only on income from oil actually produced. 6005 Depletion prohibited to a purchaser w/ certain exception Oil and gas properties transferred after 1974 and before October 11, 1990 are not eligible for percentage depletion except for transfers made by death, some code section 351 exchanges, and other nontaxable transfers.",

Accordingly, we modiﬁed your net operating loss. 6109 Interest income Interest income is considered nonbusiness income even though this is the principal source of income.

Therefore, we have reﬁgured your net operating loss deduction. 6126 Period for carryback We disallowed your net operating loss carryback. In general, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, net operating losses cannot be carried back but can be carried forward indeﬁ- nitely. 6127 Computation of net operating losses Net operating loss deductions and net operating loss carryovers for losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, are limited to 80 percent of your taxable income. We adjusted your allowable net operating loss deduction as shown in the attached computation. 6201 Adoption credit adjusted We have adjusted your adoption credit to the amount veriﬁed. 6202 Expenses do not qualify as adoption expenses Because the expenses you veriﬁed are expenses that do not qualify as adoption expenses, your credit has been disallowed. 6203 Credit disallowed/paid or reimbursed by employer The credit is available only for expenses that have not been re- imbursed. Because the adoption expenses you claimed were paid or reimbursed by your employer, we disallowed your credit. 6204 Modiﬁed AGI adjusted/ adoption credit adjusted The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modiﬁed adjusted income (MAGI). Since we adjusted your MAGI, your credit has been adjusted accordingly. 6205 Adoption not ﬁnal/not U.S. citizen or resident/ credit disallowed Because the child claimed for Adoption Credit was not a U.S. citizen or resident and the adoption did not become ﬁnal during the year, you cannot take the adoption credit. 6206 Adoption not ﬁnal/not a U.S. citizen or resident/ excl disallowed Because the child claimed for Adoption Credit was not a U.S. citizen or resident and the adoption did not become ﬁnal during the year, you cannot take the adoption exclusion. 6207 Separate return requirements/credit or exclusion disallowed You can take a credit or exclusion on a separate return if you are legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance agreement, or if you lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year and: (a) your home is the eligible child’s home for more than half the year, and (b) you paid more than half the cost of keeping up your home for the year. Since you have not met these requirements, your credit or exclusion has been disallowed.",

The credit is computed on Schedule R. Since you did not meet the requirements this credit is disallowed. 6709 Adjusted due to change in ﬁling status The computation of the credit for the elderly or the permanently and totally disabled includes a reduction by one-half of the excess of adjusted gross income over the following levels, based on ﬁling status: single, $7,500; married taxpayers, $10,000; married individual ﬁling separately, $5,000. Since we changed your ﬁling status, we also adjusted your credit. 6710 Incorrectly ﬁgured Your credit for the elderly or the permanently and totally disabled was ﬁgured incorrectly. The correct computation is attached. 6711 Initial amount used may not be more than taxable disability income The initial amount used in ﬁguring the credit for permanently and totally disabled individuals under age 65 may not be more than the taxable disability income. We adjusted your credit using the correct computation. 6712 Credit for the elderly or disabled We adjusted your credit for the elderly or the permanently and totally disabled. 6801 RESERVED na 6901 Adjusted credit for excess FICA tax We have adjusted your credit for excess FICA (social security and Medicare) taxes withheld, as shown. 6902 Credit for excess FICA disallowed A husband and wife may not combine the FICA taxes withheld from their wages to compute credit for excess FICA taxes withheld. 6903 Recover from employer Since you had only one employer during the year, no credit is allowed for excess FICA (social security and Medicare) tax withheld. You should recover the excess withheld from your employer. 6904 Credit for excess FICA allowed You are allowed a credit for excess FICA (social security and Medicare) taxes withheld during the taxable year.",

Tax withheld prior to the marriage is being credited to your spouse’s account. 9008 Domicile establishment rule An assignment in a community property state due to military orders does not constitute establishment of domicile in that state. 9009 Separate returns- deductions allocated When a husband and wife ﬁle separate returns claiming community property beneﬁts, half of the community income and half of the itemized deductions are allocated to each spouse. Therefore, we have disallowed half of the itemized deductions you claimed. 9010 Disallowed beneﬁts/not estab spouse inc subject to community beneﬁts It has not been established that your spouse’s income is subject to the law of any jurisdiction that grants one spouse a present vested interest in 50 percent of the other’s income from personal services. Therefore, we have disallowed community property beneﬁts. 9011 NR alien and spouse-no joint return election-no comm. laws apply Since you and your nonresident alien spouse did not elect to ﬁle a joint return for the tax year, community property laws do not apply to earned income, business income, partnership income, and income from separately owned property. Therefore, that income is treated as belonging to the spouse earning the income or owning the property. 9101 Math error We have adjusted your return because of a mathematical error on it. 9102 Wrong line/column of tax table The tax on your return was incorrectly computed from a column or line of a Tax Table. 9103 Used tax table/should have been tax rate The tax on your return was incorrectly computed from a Tax Table instead of a Tax Rate Schedule. 9104 Amount claimed twice This amount is not deductible since it was properly claimed elsewhere on your return. 9201 Not organization exempt from tax You do not qualify as an organization exempt from taxation. See IRC 501(c). 9202 Accumulated earnings tax/computation We have applied the accumulated earnings tax because you were ed or availed of for the purpose of your shareholders avoiding income tax. See the attached computation. 9203 Dividend received deduction/computation We have adjusted your dividend received deduction as shown in the accompanying computation.",
