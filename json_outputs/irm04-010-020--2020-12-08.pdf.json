These workpapers typically include ﬁnal trial balances for each entity and a schedule of consolidating and adjusting entries. They include used to trace ﬁnancial information to the tax return. Any tax return preparation documents that reconcile net income per books or ﬁnancial statements to taxable income are also tax reconciliation workpapers. Tax reconciliation papers do not become tax accrual workpapers when they are used in the preparation of tax accrual workpapers or are attached to tax accrual workpa- pers. Preexisting documents that a taxpayer, the taxpayer’s accountant, or taxpayer’s independent auditor consults, refers to, or relies upon in making evaluations or decisions regarding the tax reserves or in performing an audit are not themselves considered tax accrual workpapers or audit workpapers, even though the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s accountant, or independent auditor may store such documents with the tax accrual workpapers or audit workpa- pers.
