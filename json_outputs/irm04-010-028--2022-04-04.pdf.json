The Area Counsel and examination personnel will make a reasonable effort to identify other cases presenting the proposed designated issue to allow for IRS-wide strategic coordination. If the Area Counsel concurs that it is appropriate to consider designation, then examination personnel will prepare a written memorandum that sets forth the facts of the case and the factors and justiﬁcations that support considering designation of the issue in the case for litigation. This initial request memorandum will be reviewed and approved by the Area Counsel and the ﬁrst-level executive with jurisdiction over the examination; it will then be forwarded to the ap- plicable second-level executive (Examination Director) with jurisdiction over the case and the appropriate Division Counsel. b. The Examination Director and the Division Counsel will consult on the merits of designating the issue for litigation. The Division Counsel will also consult with the appropriate Associate Chief Counsel with jurisdiction over the issue. c. If the Examination Director and the Division Counsel, after consultation with the Associate Chief Counsel, conclude that designation for litigation is appropriate, the Division Counsel will prepare the Designation Recom- mendation Memorandum (DRM) for the Examination Director’s signature and concurrence. The DRM must set forth the rationale for the recom- mendation. After concurring in the DRM, the Examination Director must notify the taxpayer in writing of the proposed designation, the rationale the recommendation, and that the matter will be referred to the BOD Deputy Commissioner. The Examination Director’s written notice of the proposed designation will also provide the taxpayer an opportunity to submit its views on the designation recommendation in writing and/or to request a meeting with the BOD Deputy Commissioner and the Division Counsel within",
