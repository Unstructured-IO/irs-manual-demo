Exhibits • Moved exhibits to Knowledge Management to improve the end-user expe- rience. Contents were not changed. Only the location of the exhibits changed, and the format, so changes were not deemed material changes, and IRM streamline clearance was followed per IRM 1.11.9.2.1, Instances of Streamlined Clearance. The exhibits were last dated in 2004; thus, technologies have improved and the transfer to Knowledge Management as an excel ﬁle format is a value-added change. • Exhibits as published did not comply with 508 requirements per Document 12835, The IRM Style Guide because there were blank cells and merged cells in the table. • The content found in the Exhibits did not belong in the IRM per IRM 1.11.2.2, IRM Standards.",
