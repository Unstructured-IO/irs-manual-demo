This IRM was originally created response to a TIGTA audit requiring Examination Head Quarters to follow written procedures. No such IRM existed at the time of the issuance of the audit. This IRM was created as a stop-gap measure, so an IRM was put in place to comply with the new standards. In the meantime, a more complete and detailed IRM was being prepared that covered other areas of Examination Head Quarters. That IRM is now complete and can be found at IRM",
