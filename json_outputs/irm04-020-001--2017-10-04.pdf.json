Installment Agreement (IA) An IA allows the payment of the debt in smaller, more manageable amounts. IAs generally require equal monthly payment that will result in full payment of the tax within the collection period. Levy A levy is a legal seizure of the taxpayer’s property to satisfy a tax debt. Levies are different from liens. Lien A lien is a legal claim to the property of the taxpayer as security for a tax debt. The federal tax lien arises when the liability is assessed, notice and demand for payment have been given, and the taxpayer neglects or refuses to pay the debt. Notice should be given as soon as possible after assessment (but within 60 days). If the taxpayer neglects or refuses to pay the assessed tax, the lien is deemed to relate back to the assessment date. After that time, the IRS may ﬁle a notice of federal tax lien in the public records. The purpose of ﬁling the notice of federal tax lien is to establish the government’s right of priority against certain third party creditors. It puts the public on notice that a federal tax lien will continue until the liability is satisﬁed, becomes unenforceable by lapse of time (collection statute expires), or a bond is accepted in the amount of liability. Offer-in-Compromise (OIC) OIC may be requested by taxpayer on the following basis: • DATL, • DATC, or • ETA An OIC is a taxpayer’s proposal to the government for settlement of a liability for an amount less than previously determined and assessed. Generally, DATC and ETA offers in compromise are considered by the Collection function and DATL offers are consid- ered by the Examination function. See IRM 5.8.11, Offer-in- Compromise, Effective Tax Administration. See 26 CFR 301.7122- 1(b), Grounds for Compromise, for a detailed description of each type of offer. 4.20.1.1.7 (1) The following table contains related IRMs which cover additional procedures (10-04-2017) that examiners may use in their general collectibility procedures and are refer- Related Resources enced throughout this IRM: IRM Title IRM 2.4.28 IDRS Terminal Input - Command Codes STAUP, STATI, and STATB IRM 4.10.2.4.1 Pre Contact Responsibilities - Collectibility IRM 4.18.7.1 Exam Offer-in-Compromise, Special Case Processing - Offer-in-",
