Compliant taxpayers want to know that the IRS is capable of ensuring that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. The IRS uses a variety of techniques such as document matching, correspondence and audits to verify that taxpayers accurately report their tax liability. The IRS should only audit those returns most likely to have errors. Various methods are used to identify errors prior to contacting the taxpayer with the most common method using Discriminant Function (DIF) formulas to select returns for exami- nation. (",

This challenge is comparable to a corporation demonstrating to its shareholders that it is worthy of their invest- ment and their business. Optimally, this is accomplished through objective measurement of the corporate ﬁnancial health and the factors that contribute it. Likewise, the IRS needs to measure taxpayer compliance with federal income tax laws along with contributing factors so that customer-focused programs and services can be enhanced or developed, and compliance infor- mation and tools can be improved.
