    "text": "Examination techniques will vary signiﬁcantly depending upon the type of records maintained. It is common to have both computerized and manual records based upon the type of ﬁnancial service provided. For instance, an MSB may have computerized records for wire transmissions and manual records for check cashing. The examiner should determine whether it is appropriate to request electronic downloads based on the records available at the ﬁnancial institution. Third party downloads should not be requested for entities that have a sufficient POS system or have other records to make proper BSA compliance tions. A money order seller that maintains closeout reports is an example where the electronic record may not be needed. A POS system that identiﬁes customer’s purchase of multiple ﬁnancial services as one unique transaction may help identify suspicious activity more efficiently than reviewing the downloads of each ﬁnancial service.",
