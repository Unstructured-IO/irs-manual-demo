If the taxpayer concedes the issue, the case should not be designated. A threat to pay the tax and ﬁle a refund suit should not alter the decision to designate. If a taxpayer pays the tax and ﬁles a refund suit after the case is designated, the Department of Justice will be apprised of the designation and take it into consideration when handling the case.",

Chief Counsel should be contacted to discuss the appropriate procedures to follow if the issue in question is an employment tax issue. In general, the designation of an issue in a case will not preclude the settlement of the remaining issues either before or after the case is docketed.
