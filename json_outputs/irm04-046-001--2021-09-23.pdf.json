This process should be conducted collaboratively by the ex- amination team with the initial risk being identiﬁed in the planning phase. Once the examination team determines the issues to be examined, the team will share the issues identiﬁed with the taxpayer. To leverage and effectively use our resources, a risk analysis should be issue driven with consideration given to available resources, materiality, timing and other factors that will impact voluntary compliance. As the examination progresses and issues are developed, the risk analysis should be reviewed and updated accordingly. In addition, the taxpayer should be timely advised of any changes.
