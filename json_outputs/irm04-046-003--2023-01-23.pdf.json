Return information, including related returns, should be reviewed to determine possible large, unusual and questionable amounts. The risk analysis should consider the size and complexity of the return which include related entities, changes between years and locations of entities. b. Claims and voluntary disclosures c. Potential tax adjustment compared with the resources needed. d. Signiﬁcant interrelated issues which, if fully developed, would require ditional returns to be brought under examination. For example, recognition of income and deduction of expenses between related parties or the tax treatment and valuation of assets in mergers and acquisitions may require expansion of examination to include related returns. e.
