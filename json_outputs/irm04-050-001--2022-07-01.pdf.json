As part of the prioritization and triage, CP&A requests the involvement of a PN SME to assist in developing a ﬁlter that will identify returns with the issue identiﬁed in the campaign submission. The SME works with CP&A to develop a formula based on items anticipated to be on tax returns. Part I of the RICB form requesting approval for the ﬁlter is prepared. The purpose of the initial ﬁlter is to generally identify the population from tax return and other data. This step may include consideration of possible interac- tion of various tax return line items and forms to incorporate areas the ﬁeld typically considers in risking for the issue. None of these activities are workload selection that will cause separation of duty concerns. SMEs may also be involved in analyzing the redacted results of the Part I ﬁlter output. They can provide input to further reﬁne the ﬁlter to narrow results and provide more focus. However, SMEs may NOT be involved in reviewing un-redacted output of ﬁlters. SMEs can assist CP&A in preparing the Part II RICB request, but cannot see the Part II ﬁlter results (where taxpayer identifying information is involved). If SMEs review un-redacted ﬁlter results, or participate in classiﬁca- tion (see below) of particular taxpayers, they cannot participate in examining or mentoring examining agents in connection with those taxpayers. They can par- ticipate in generic network calls, and discuss and consult on issues arising in the campaign, to the extent not taxpayer speciﬁc. They may also mentor and advise with respect to other taxpayers. (",

These disclosures frequently contain identifying information, including names and EINS of promotors and participants. For instance, if the campaign involves a transaction of interest or listed transaction notice, the participant and material advisor disclosures are reviewed. This screening, sorting, or grouping process is typically performed by examiners or SMEs. Reviews at this stage are generally intended to sort the population into more manageable groups, but for the purpose of selecting them for examination. Usually, the goal is to narrow the population by risk and select participants (and their returns) or materials advisors to forward for classiﬁcation. Individuals involved in disclo- sure reviews for triage and developing a campaign submission or developing classiﬁcation materials for classiﬁers to use in determining which cases to will not be considered by LB&I to be involved in workload selection. Accord- ingly, they are permitted to participate and advise in network calls, and may consult on taxpayer-speciﬁc issues arising in the campaign. Sometimes, however, the disclosure review directly identiﬁes returns for examination without the need for further classiﬁcation. In those instances, the individuals involved may not consult on taxpayer-speciﬁc issues arising in the campaign. (",
