Bilateral tax treaties . The provisions of these bilateral agreements, also known as tax conventions or double taxation conventions (DTCs), are primarily intended to eliminate double taxation with respect to certain taxes without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. DTCs generally include articles autho- rizing the exchange of tax-related information between the jurisdictions. Note: In addition to bilateral income tax treaties, the U.S. has entered bilateral estate and/or gift tax treaties with certain foreign jurisdic- tions. Those treaties may authorize exchanges of information between the jurisdictions for estate and/or gift tax purposes. Never- theless, the exchange of information provisions of bilateral income tax treaties may also authorize exchanges for estate and/or gift tax purposes. b. Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) . These bilateral agree- ments allow only for the exchange of tax-related information, and unlike tax treaties, do not contain provisions related to double taxation. TIEAs are executive agreements, and do not require ratiﬁcation by the U.S. Senate. c. Multilateral treaties and agreements . Certain multilateral agreements which the United States is a party also authorize EOI for tax purposes, such as the OECD/Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Administra- tive Assistance in Tax Matters (Multilateral Convention, MAAC, or MAC), the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence, and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Exchange under the Multilateral Convention may allow for exchange of tax-related infor- mation with many jurisdictions. d.

Procedures about the use and disclosure of the exchanged information, which generally require that information received be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of the receiving jurisdiction, and which permit disclosure of such information only to persons or authorities (such as courts and administrative bodies) speciﬁed by the agreement as concerned with the assessment or collec- tion of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes covered by the agreement for exchange of information purposes; c.
