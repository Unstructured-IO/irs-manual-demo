Note that “MAP” and “competent authority” are fre- quently used interchangeably when acting as modiﬁers (e.g., MAP request and competent authority request). MAP Report Certain documentation developed by Examination which the U.S. Competent Authority may use in a competent authority case. See IRM 4.46.6, LB&I Examination Process, Workpapers and Reports for additional information. OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De- velopment. Primary Adjustment The initial adjustment, which generally increases the taxable income of a member of a group of con- trolled taxpayers, and creates a corresponding decrease in the taxable income of one or more members of the same group. Primary Taxpayer Taxpayer whose taxable income is affected by the primary adjustment. SAP The Simultaneous Appeals Procedure (SAP) is a process that allows taxpayers to request the services of Appeals and the U.S. Competent Authority simultaneously. The procedure is intended to facilitate the U.S. Competent Authori- ty’s unilateral consideration of a resolution of the competent authority issue before it presents a position on the issue to the foreign competent authority. The U.S. Competent Authority in its sole discretion will decide whether to accept the taxpay- er’s request for SAP review after consulting with IRS Appeals and after considering whether SAP review would unduly burden tax administration, including the competent authority process. The U.S. Competent Authority may choose to accept SAP review with respect to only certain competent authority issues. See Rev. Proc. 2015-40, Section 6.04(2) for additional information.",
