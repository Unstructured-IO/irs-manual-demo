    "text": "IRM 4.71.11 contained the procedures for conducting Office Correspondence Examinations (OCE). On October 5, 2018, Internal Guidance Memo (IGM) TE/GE-04-1018-0024 with the subject line “Single Type of Examination” was issued. The IGM is effective immediately and provides that examinations are no longer classiﬁed as either “Field” or “OCE”. The IGM’s result is a single type of examination. The examination’s location is determined by the agent and the front-line manager on a case by case basis. Accordingly, this IRM is no longer applicable and is obsolete as of October 5,",
