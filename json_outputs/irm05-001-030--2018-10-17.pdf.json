It did not add, remove, replace, or otherwise change existing IRM procedures. As such, it does not meet the criteria set forth in IRM 1.11.2.2, IRM Standards, as the primary, official compilation of “instructions to staff.” All information contained in this IRM was based on, derived from, and subordinate to primary guidance found throughout IRM Part 5. Resolution-directed approach to casework principals have been incorporated into various Collection Training materials for both new recruits and experienced revenue officers. Direct citations to IRM 5.1.30 should be removed from existing IRM sections and replaced, where appropriate, by references to primary source material found throughout IRM Part 5, Collecting Process.",
