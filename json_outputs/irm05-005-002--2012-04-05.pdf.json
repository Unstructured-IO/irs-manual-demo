The Service needs to carefully consider attorney fees that are charged for litigation concerning assets when it is unlikely that after payment of taxes and other creditors these assets would be transferred to beneficiaries. For example, beneficiaries are suing the estate for ownership of a house but the house must be sold to pay claims against the estate. Therefore attorney fees should not be allowed since the asset must be sold to pay claims and it is unlikely the beneficiary would receive the property because liquidation of this asset is necessary to pay claims before a distribution can be made.
