The officer’s ownership interest in the business and any control over the compensa- tion received should also be a consideration. • Stock Holder Distributions – These expenses are discretionary in nature. Evaluate distributions of this nature made after the incurrence of the tax delinquency under the dissipated asset provisions. • Repayment of Loans to Officers - Loans to officers should be consid- ered an account receivable and valued according to their collectibility. Loans to shareholders may be an indication the taxpayer is paying personal expenses from the corporation’s accounts or receiving payment in the form of loans in lieu of a salary. If the funds are being received on a consistent basis, you may include an amount as income on the IET. Historic activity of the loans to shareholders could provide evidence of consistent payment. Additionally, a determination of an alter ego/nominee situation may also be appropriate based on the amount being received or taken out of the business for personal expenses. Refer to IRM",
