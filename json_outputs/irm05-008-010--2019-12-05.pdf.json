(8) If only one party to a joint assessment ﬁles an OIC, then the statute is suspended just for that person. The appropriate CSED suspension code must be input on IDRS to identify the speciﬁc taxpayer for which the offer applies. They are described below. • P = Primary • S = Secondary • B = Both (1) A taxpayer submitting an offer in compromise agrees to the extension of the statute of limitations for assessment. The extension allows the Service the op- of Previous Offers portunity to evaluate the terms of an offer without the assessment statute Statute expiring in the meantime. Date (2) An offer is considered pending or “being reviewed” when an authorized Service official signs the Form 656 up until the date a determination is made. The TC 480 date is the date the offer was signed by an authorized Service official and is therefore the date the pending period begins. (3) For an offer that has been accepted, the assessment statute is extended for the time the offer is pending up until the date the Service acknowledges ac- ceptance of the offer in writing. (4) For an offer that has been rejected, returned (processable), terminated or withdrawn, the amount of any federal tax due for a tax period included on the offer may be assessed on the date by which any debt must currently be assessed plus the period of time the offer is pending plus one year.",
