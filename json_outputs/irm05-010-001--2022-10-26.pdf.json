A lease can independently have value or, when combined with other assets, contribute to an overall value when the business is appraised as a turn-key or ongoing business concern. One to determine whether a lease has independent value is to contact a commer- cial realtor in the area to determine the going rental rate for similar properties. If the taxpayer’s lease reﬂects a lower rate, the lease may independently value separate from the other assets. In other circumstances, a leasehold have value only to speciﬁc bidders and not the general market.

If the taxpayer is delinquent, determine whether the lessor is considered a rightful occupant. When the IRS enters into a Landlord Agreement with the taxpayer or owner of the property, the Landlord does not serve as an eviction of the occupant. After the sale, return the pos- session of the premises to the rightful occupant based on the terms of the Landlord Agreement. For example, the taxpayer is determined to be the occupant of the real estate where the personal property is seized and agrees to a short term Landlord Agreement with the IRS until a sale is completed.

The lessor is due a reasonable amount of rental payments for the time the IRS has possession of the space once any pre-paid rent expires. If provided for under the terms of the taxpay- er’s lease, the lessor may be entitled to access the premises. Seizure of the leasehold interest early in the month after the current lease payment is made will reduce the expenses associated with the seizure and sale. A leasehold interest cannot be seized for the sole purpose of storing personal property locking the taxpayer out of the property pending sale. The leasehold interest must be seized only for the purpose of sale. (",

For example, a taxpayer current on a lease may be the only rightful occupant and the lessor may not have any standing to negotiate a Landlord Agreement with the IRS when the personal property is the only being seized. If the taxpayer is delinquent, determine whether the lessor is considered a rightful occupant. When the IRS enters into a Landlord Agreement with the taxpayer or owner of the property, the Landlord does not serve as an eviction of the occupant. After the sale, return the pos- session of the premises to the rightful occupant based on the terms of the Landlord Agreement. For example, the taxpayer is determined to be the occupant of the real estate where the personal property is seized and agrees to a short term Landlord Agreement with the IRS until a sale is completed. At the conclusion of the sale, access and keys to the real estate are returned to the taxpayer and not the owner of the real estate. (",

    "text": "The revenue officer should complete an equity analysis and using 60 % of FMV, the RFSV of thevehicles is $50,000. With estimated expenses of $3,000, the expected net sale proceeds would be$47,000. The taxpayer is a \"won't pay\" taxpayer because the corporation is not in compliance withFederal Tax Deposits and will not provide financial information. The revenue officer then conducts arisk analysis — there are no reasonable alternative collection methods. The taxpayer does not qualifyfor an installment agreement or offer in compromise. Other methods of enforcement have already beenconsidered. Since the assets have equity and the risk analysis provides no reasonable alternatives, theseizure should be recommended after all appropriate pre-seizure actions have been completed.",
