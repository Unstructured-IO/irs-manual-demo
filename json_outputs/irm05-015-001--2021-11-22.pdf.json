Housing and Utilities - Standards are established for each county within a state and are derived from Census and BLS data. The standard for a particular county and family size includes both housing and utilities allowed for a taxpayer’s primary place of residence. Housing and Utilities standards include mortgage (including interest) or rent, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, gas, electric, water, heating oil, garbage collection, cable television, internet services, telephone and cell phone. b. Transportation - The transportation standards consist of nationwide ﬁgures for loan or lease payments referred to as ownership costs, and additional amounts for operating costs broken down by Census Region and Metropolitan Statistical Area. Operating costs include maintenance, repairs, insurance, fuel, registrations, licenses, inspections, parking and tolls. If a taxpayer has a car payment, the allowable ownership cost added to the allowable operating cost equals the allowable transportation expense. If a taxpayer has a car, but no car payment only the operating cost portion of the transportation standard is used to ﬁgure the allowable transportation expense. There is a single nationwide allowance for public transportation for taxpayers with no vehicle. Note: Vehicle Operating standards are based on actual consumer expen- diture data obtained from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which are adjusted with Consumer Price Indexes (CPI) to allow for projected increases throughout the year. (These CPI are used to adjust all ALE standards.) Vehicle operating standards are not based on average commuting distances. Fuel costs, which are part of Vehicle Operating Costs, have a separate fuel price adjustment which is based on Energy Information Admin- istration (EIA) data which allows for projected fuel price increases.

There may be reasonable exceptions, such as foster children or children for whom adoption is pending. • An allowance for cell phone, cable television and internet service expenses is included in the Housing and Utilities standard. • Taxpayers are allowed the standard amount for housing and utilities or the amount actually claimed and veriﬁed by the taxpayer, whichever is less. If the amount claimed is more than the total allowed by housing and utilities standards, the taxpayer must provide documentation to stantiate those expenses are necessary. • When deciding if a deviation is appropriate, consider the cost of moving to a new residence; the increased cost of transportation to work and school that will result from moving to lower-cost housing and the tax consequences. The tax consequence is the difference between the beneﬁt the taxpayer currently derives from the interest and property deductions on Schedule A to the beneﬁt the taxpayer would derive without the same or adjusted expense. • All deviations from the housing and utilities standards must be veriﬁed, reasonable and documented in the case history.

It is usually calculated by adding depreciation and any other non-cash charges to earnings after taxes. Investors look to cash ﬂow for several reasons: • Firms have accounting leeway when it comes to reporting net income; • Depreciation charges, while substantial in many industries, aren’t genuine bills that have to be paid; and • Cash ﬂow is the key to a company’s ability to pay dividends, cover debts and so forth. Thus, some analysts focus on the ratio of price to cash ﬂow rather than the traditional price/earnings (P/E) measure. Cash ﬂow is especially useful in assessing ﬁrms in capital-intensive industries where huge depreciation charges can hide healthy proﬁts. (",

A reverse mortgage is a loan where the lender pays the homeowner (in a lump sum, a monthly advance, a line of credit, or a combination of all three) while the homeowner continues to live in his/her home. With a reverse mortgage, the homeowner retains title to the home. Depending on the plan, the reverse mortgage becomes due with interest when the homeowner moves, sells the home, reaches the end of a pre-selected loan period, or dies.
