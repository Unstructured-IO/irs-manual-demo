Consent directives are used when the law of the country in which the records are located prevents disclosure to persons other than the unless the taxpayer consents to the disclosure. Consent directives can be obtained voluntarily directly from the taxpayer or court order. When a consent directive is obtained voluntarily, some foreign countries will view this favorably and comply with the consent directive. On other hand, some countries may not honor a consent directive that was compelled by court order.
