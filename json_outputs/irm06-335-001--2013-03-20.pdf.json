Appointing an employee to an established position gives better recognition to management needs and the employee’s new responsibilities and the employee for the higher graded work performed. Therefore, managers refrain from rotating assignments of employees to avoid compensation of a particular employee at the higher level. This would not, however, preclude use of details to higher graded positions without a time-limited promotion, for the purpose of providing a developmental opportunity or for such reasons as workload considerations and/or budget limitations for a brief period of time.
