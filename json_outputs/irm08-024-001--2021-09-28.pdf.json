Reg. 301.6159-1(e)(5) authorizes an appeal of both IA terminations and modiﬁcations by the IRS. 8.24.1.1.6(2) Updated TBOR content based on guidance from the Division Counsel/ Associate Chief Counsel (National Taxpayer Advocate Program) and Branch 3 of the Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and Administration). 8.24.1.2(5)(b) Noted an exception to the 5 business day turnaround goal on CAP cases, related to taxpayer access to the administrative ﬁle. 8.24.1.2(5)(c) Added a note emphasizing that Appeals consider the appropriateness of the monthly installment amount upon review of the taxpayer’s ﬁnancial informa- tion, when addressing a CAP IA. 8.24.1.2(5)(c) (Example 1) Moved from 8.24.1.3.8(13) for effective placement of the guidance. 8.24.1.3(2)(g)(Note) Revised note to indicate that a request to return levy proceeds must be made within 2 years from the date of such levy; removed reference to the prior 9 month deadline from the date of the levy, if it was made on or before March 22, 2017, to make a request to return levy proceeds. 8.24.1.3(4) Clariﬁed that third parties claiming property was wrongfully levied are entitled to CAP before the levy proceeds are turned over to the Service and applied toward the taxpayer’s liability. 8.24.1.3(5) Clariﬁed that a taxpayer who claims that the levy is “erroneous” is entitled to a CAP before the levy proceeds are turned over to the Service and applied toward the taxpayer’s liability. Once the levied proceeds are applied toward the taxpayer’s liability, the taxpayer may make an administrative claim, per Publication 5149. 8.24.1.3(5)(Note) Added note to clarify the taxpayer may request the return of levied funds via the managerial conference. If the taxpayer’s request is disallowed, the taxpayer may ﬁle a CAP, which would meet the administrative claim require- ments under Treasury Reg. 301.6343-3(h).",
