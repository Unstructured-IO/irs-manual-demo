    "text": ") When considering hazards for a potential settlement, knowing who carries the burden of proof on an issue helps clarify how speciﬁc evidence, or the lack of speciﬁc evidence, might inﬂuence the outcome should litigation occur. Example: When disputing willfulness by claiming all available funds were encum- bered, the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that no unencumbered funds were available for payment. So, they must show by preponder- ance of evidence that the business was legally obligated to use their funds for purposes other than payment of trust fund liabilities, and that the legal obligation had priority over the IRS’s interest. In the case a taxpayer contends that the funds in the business bank account were encumbered and subject to a lender bank’s superior security interest, they have the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence the existence of the superior lien. The burden of proof is not met where there is no evidence that the lender bank restricted the business’ ability to use funds to satisfy pre-existing tax obligations. In addition, if the taxpayer was the one who entered the business into the agreement that allowed the control of the business accounts to pass to a third party, they can still be found liable for the non-payment of trust fund taxes, even if there is evidence that the third party restricted the business’ ability to use funds to satisfy the tax.
