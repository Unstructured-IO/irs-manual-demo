Both technical and behavioral skill development is emphasized through- out the program. Critical thinking skills, with the underlying emphasis on core values, in a problem solving training environment. The program is practical exercise intensive. e. The trainees “work” three tax-training investigations. Individual blocks of instruction range from the “how-to’s” of numbering an investigation to more substantive instruction in interviewing techniques, report writing, documentation of evidence, the different methods of proving income, ﬁnancial search warrants, and testifying in judicial proceedings. f. Trainees plan and conduct interviews ranging from a simple third-party interview to complex subject interviews, using a wide variety of ing techniques. g. Detailed presentations are made relative to the speciﬁc item, net worth, and bank deposit methods of proving income. h. Trainees formulate and write a detailed Special Agent’s Report (SAR). Each trainee prepares many memoranda, schedules, and summaries throughout the course. i. All of these blocks of instruction are provided to the trainees as they the different tax investigations. The instruction is woven throughout the investigation activity in a manner to enable each trainee to reinforce, through practice, what was learned in the classroom, thereby expanding the trainees’ knowledge base and reﬁning their investigative skills. j. The ﬁrst tax training investigation is an administrative speciﬁc item investi- gation. The second tax investigation is an expansion of the ﬁrst. Speciﬁcally, it is a grand jury investigation, which emphasizes the indirect methods of proving unreported income. The third investigation involves a QRP/RPP investigation. This training investigation emphasizes the evalua- tion of a return preparer scheme and the planning and preparation to conduct a QRP/RPP undercover shopping operation. k. In addition, training is provided in conducting money laundering investiga- tions and in those other areas which are necessary to enable the new special agents to successfully carry out their duties and responsibilities. l. Instruction is provided in the hard skill areas of integrated use of force, armed escort, and additional ﬁrearms training. The integrated use of force training introduces the trainee to CI’s use of force procedures and of classroom instruction and physical training in weaponless tactics and team tactics. The ﬁrearms training includes range time and Simunitions. (",
