Notify local law enforcement authorities and the TIGTA. c. Act as an intermediary or assign a “companion agent” to act as an inter- mediary between the special agents, the TIGTA, and local law enforcement authorities until the special agents regain their composure and understand their rights. d. Ensure that the special agents involved in the incident receive prompt medical attention, if needed; are removed from the scene as soon as possible; and are not subject to media attention. e. If the discharge of a special agent’s firearm resulted in injury or death, ensure that the firearms and spent cartridges are placed into evidence with local law enforcement authorities. Normally, a different firearm is issued to the special agent until his/her regular weapon is returned. f. If special agents are injured, personal contacts should be afforded to their families and transportation provided to the site of treatment. If feasible, contacts should be by someone who knows the families, by a senior special agent, or by an SSA. g. For more detailed information about the role of a SSA in trauma see IRM",
