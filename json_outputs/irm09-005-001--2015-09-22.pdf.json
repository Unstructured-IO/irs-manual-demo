To support an allegation of unreported sales, witnesses should be inter- viewed to determine: whether checks and invoices represent all the transactions that occurred; whether the documents truthfully record the events; whether additional sums might have been paid or refunded; whether there were any other methods of payment or other parties to transactions; and whether there is other relevant information. b.
