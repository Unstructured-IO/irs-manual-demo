The major difference between a fee-for-service and a capitated plan (managed care usually by an HMO) is the delivery of and payment for services. In a fee-for-service, proﬁts increase with increased submission of billings for services. Capitated payments are based on a per-patient rate. The medical provider in a capitated HMO plan reaps proﬁts if the cost of services for a patient is less than the allocated payment per patient. The of services is a signiﬁcant consideration in the capitated system, while over utilization of services (i.e. over billings) is a concern in the fee-for-service system. There has been a trend toward managed care, or HMOs, in the care industry. Healthy patients are selecting less costly HMOs versus the tional fee-for-service plans. Investigators have to concentrate on vulnerable areas of fraud, particularly with the knowledge that the underutilization of services is a concern in this particular industry and provides the opportunity kickbacks to keep referrals for service to a minimum.

The major difference between a fee-for-service and a capitated plan (managed care usually by an HMO) is the delivery of and payment for services. In a fee-for-service, proﬁts increase with increased submission of billings for services. Capitated payments are based on a per-patient rate. The medical provider in a capitated HMO plan reaps proﬁts if the cost of services for a patient is less than the allocated payment per patient. The underutilization of services is a signiﬁcant consideration in the capitated system, while over utilization of services (i.e. over billings) is a concern in the fee-for-service system. There has been a trend toward managed care, or HMOs, in the health care industry. Healthy patients are selecting less costly HMOs versus the tradi- tional fee-for-service plans. Investigators have to concentrate on vulnerable areas of fraud, particularly with the knowledge that the underutilization of services is a concern in this particular industry and provides the opportunity for kickbacks to keep referrals for service to a minimum.",
