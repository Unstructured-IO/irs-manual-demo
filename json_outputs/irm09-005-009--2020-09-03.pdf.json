The key to a successful net worth investigation is establishing a reliable beginning net worth (opening net worth) which includes all of the assets liabilities on hand. It is this starting point from which all future increases or decreases will be calculated. This starting point is normally referred to as base year. In a net worth computation, it is extremely important to ﬁrmly establish a beginning net worth (starting point or base year) with the best evidence available. In calculating annual net worth, be aware that an inverse relationship exists between one year and the next. If the subject ’s opening net worth is stated, there is a resulting overstatement of the increase in net worth for following year. Conversely, if the subject’s opening net worth is overstated, there would be a resulting understatement of the increase in net worth for following year. The ﬁrst step to establishing a ﬁrm starting point is to determine the date (opening or base year) best suited for the investigation. The interview with subject will strengthen the starting point. While questioning the subject, the special agent should attempt to develop all information relating to the assets and liabilities for the years involved. The subject should be",
