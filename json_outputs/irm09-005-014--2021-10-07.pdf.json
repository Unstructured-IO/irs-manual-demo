It is now CI’s responsibility to ensure that criminal and/or tax related investigations are properly closed in order to allow civil tax enforcement procedures to begin or resume. IRS operating divisions may not proceed civilly until the criminal tax and/or tax related investigation is closed and any referral to the DOJ is terminated. Generally, termination of the referral is accomplished by a letter from DOJ. However, DOJ has delegated prepara- tion of the letter terminating the referral from the IRS by way of the automatic closing procedures. (",
