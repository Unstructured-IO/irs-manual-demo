For example, defense may admit the receipt of income, the acquisition of certain assets, the making of speciﬁed expenditures, or even the source and amount of income and the tax deﬁciency alleged. This agreement then relieves the government the burden of producing sufficient evidence to prove such matters and would leave willfulness as the only real issue to be proved. Since willfulness is usually inferred from the manner in which transactions are handled and proven by the testimony of a number of witnesses that dramatizes the defendant’s knowledge (thereof), the government exercises great care in agreeing to stipu- lations in investigations involving willfulness.

In this connection, it is important to remember that the agent’s testimony alone is insufficient to establish the nature of a de- fendant’s expenditures. Rather, the government must call third-party payees witnesses or introduce other independent testimonial or documentary evidence to establish the purpose of the payments. Failure to do so would create a so- called “Greenberg problem”, named after a First Circuit investigation of that name. (",

For example, the defense may admit the receipt of income, the acquisition of certain assets, the making of speciﬁed expenditures, or even the source and amount of income and the tax deﬁciency alleged. This agreement then relieves the government of the burden of producing sufficient evidence to prove such matters and would leave willfulness as the only real issue to be proved. Since willfulness is usually inferred from the manner in which transactions are handled and proven by the testimony of a number of witnesses that dramatizes the defendant’s knowledge (thereof), the government exercises great care in agreeing to stipu- lations in investigations involving willfulness.",

These costs may include the following: • airfare • taxicab fees • mileage reimbursements for use of privately-owned vehicle • toll charges • parking fees • subsistence allowance b. The cost of copying documents should be included in the costs of pros- ecution only if the copies were necessary to the prosecution and not purely investigative in nature. These would include copies used at trial, but only if the trial resulted in a conviction on the related counts. The cal- culation or estimation of these costs must be as accurate and reasonable as possible because copying costs can be extremely high when copies are made for defense attorneys during discovery proceedings or when Jencks Act material is copied at trial. c. The statutory provision that permits the recovery of fees charged by the court reporter for stenographic transcripts has generally been construed to permit recovery of costs for the transcription of testimony, e.g., Q & A’s, depositions and grand jury transcripts. Allowable costs are limited to the cost of the original and do not include the expense of duplicate copies obtained for the convenience of counsel. The underlying deposi-",

In addition, because the SA was responsible for develop- ing the evidence to sustain the ad valorem additions to the tax (except those concerning tax estimations) in the criminal investigation, the agent will often serve as a principal witness for the government in the civil trial.

Further, guilty plea in a criminal investigation will be received by the Tax Court as an admission, to be given weight according to the circumstances. For example, the taxpayer pleaded guilty to tax evasion, the plea would be sufficient to establish fraud. However, if the taxpayer pleaded guilty to failure to ﬁle a return, the plea would not necessarily prove the taxpayer had the intent to evade tax. (",
