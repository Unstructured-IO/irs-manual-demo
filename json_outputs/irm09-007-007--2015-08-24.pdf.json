If the property to be released is such that there is no registered owner, e.g., currency, usually it should be returned to the person from whom it was seized. If there is a registered of the property, such as an automobile, the property should usually be to that party, regardless of whether there is a lien or other third party interest with ownership rights to the property. However, if a third party such as a lien- holder asserts its contractual rights in a judicial proceeding and obtains a final judgment that provides satisfactory proof of its ownership interest and right to immediate possession of the property, the seizing agency may return the property to that party instead of the registered owner. Similarly, if a state authorizes a state or local law enforcement agency to take possession of the seized property, the seizing agency may release the property in accordance with that court order. If the seizing agency is aware of a third party with ownership interest in the property, regardless of whether it has asserted any contractual rights to immediate possession, it may notify the third party in advance of release to the registered owner.
