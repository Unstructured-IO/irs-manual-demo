When an equipment item’s current assignment is one of the above types of temporary control, the accountability for the equipment remains with the employee who last was assigned either permanent custody or storage location management for the item. It is incumbent on this ac- countable employee to monitor the status of the equipment while out one of these three types of temporary assignment. b. There are rare occasions when the accountability-conferring assignment must be ended while an equipment item is currently in one of these temporary assignments. For example, an employee who has permanent custody of a radio, and therefore is accountable, had to send the radio the vendor for repair, so the current assignment would be consignment. Before the radio is returned to the office, the employee separates from and can therefore no longer be held accountable for the radio. In these types of instances, there is a sixth type of assignment referred to as ″ interim home ″ assignment. The interim home assignment would be an active storage location to which the accountability could be assigned this radio until it is returned to the office and reassigned to an employee or storage location.",
