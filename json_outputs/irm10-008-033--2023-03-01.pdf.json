Note that this resource class switch speciﬁes for which classes RACF checking is in effect. ALTER (RACF) A level of access a group or individual may have. This access level allows the group members or individuals to read, copy, move, change or delete a partitioned, sequential or VSAM data set or read, copy, move, change or delete members within a partitioned dataset. AUDIT (RACF) This resource class switch speciﬁes which classes RACF is to log every time a rule is created, changed, or deleted. Should be turned on for every resource class. AUDITOR (RACF) A system or group level attribute that gives the holder the ability to run specialized reports, monitor the system or group resources, and to set auditing features for others. AUTH request (RACF) The primary function of an AUTH request is to check a user’s authoriza- tion to a RACF–protected resource or function. This is accomplished by issuing the RACROUTE macro with REQUEST=AUTH speciﬁed. BACKUP RACF Database (RACF) The database that is a carbon copy of the primary RACF database with all of the current RACF rules. It must be on a different DASD volume from the Primary RACF Database for security purposes in case there is a system crash or other problem(s). BPXPRMxx (RACF) The SYS1.PARMLIB member that contains the parameters that control the z/OS UNIX environment. It controls the way features work and it estab- lishes logical access to data by conﬁguring the HFS environment. Cataloged Datasets Report (RACF) DSMON report. See SYSCAT CLAUTH (RACF) Class Authority, granted to a RACF CLASS. This can be assigned to the USER class and to most any General Resource class. A user to whom CLAUTH has been assigned is authorized to create new proﬁles within that class. CMDVIOL (RACF) This setting causes an SMF (log) record to be written for every RACF command violation. CONTROL (RACF) This access authority grants a user the ability to deﬁne and delete VSAM datasets and is used for some resource proﬁles to give additional authority. It is one step lower than ALTER authority. DFLTGRP (RACF) Default Group DSMON (RACF) Data Security Monitor ENHANCED GENERIC NAMING (RACF) An option that determines whether *, **, or % may be used for dsnames. Always a good idea.",

SAUDIT (RACF) A SETROPTS parameter, which turns on the logging of all RACF commands issued by users with the SYSTEM SPECIAL or Group SPECIAL attribute. Security Level (RACF) A classiﬁcation of information deﬁned by a sensitivity level. In RACF, an installation deﬁned name that corresponds to a numerical security level (the higher the number, the higher the security level). SETROPTS (RACF) A RACF command used to set system–wide RACF options dynamically. Used for, but not limited to, establishing password rules, setting audit options on SPECIAL and OPERATIONS users, activating various RACF classes. Single Level Name Preﬁx (RACF) An option that speciﬁes which preﬁx RACF is to use when DSNAMES have only one qualiﬁer. This is only used for ﬁles on tape and cartridge. Single level ﬁle names are not allowed on DASD. SPT (Started Procedures Table) (RACF) The module name is ICHRIN03 and is sometimes known as the Started Task Table. This is a RACF controlled table that assigns a UserID and a group to a started procedure that can be used to determine RACF access authorities. It can assign RACF bypass privileges of PRIVILEGED or TRUSTED. SPECIAL (RACF) A System or Group level attribute which grants the user full control over all of the RACF proﬁles in the RACF database and allows for the issuance of all commands except auditing. Group SPECIAL only has this authority within the scope of the group. Standard Access List (RACF) A list within a RACF proﬁle, showing all authorized groups and users and the access authority of each. The access list should contain only groups, SYSTEMIDs or other foreign UserIDs. Individual users who have addi- tional responsibilities beyond their standard groups shall represent a special exception or situation. STC (RACF) Started Tasks STARTUP_PROC (RACF) The parameter speciﬁes the name of the JCL procedure (PROC) that starts the z/OS UNIX component. This started task must be deﬁned to the ACP. The name OMVS must be used. STATISTICS (RACF) This resource class switch speciﬁes classes for which RACF is to keep reference counts for discrete proﬁles. Status (RACF) Refers to the state of the RACF primary and backup databases. A database can be set to active or inactive using the RVARY command. Since IRS Systems always have a primary and a backup RACF database, the RVARY command is not used to go into FAILSOFT processing. STEPLIBLIST (RACF) The parameter speciﬁes the pathname of the HFS ﬁle that contains the list of MVS data sets that are used as step libraries for programs that have the set-user-id or set group id permission bit set.

The Unisys security administrator determines the range based on the Unisys Standard Access Matrix and speciﬁes it in user security records. Demand Run (Unisys) A set of instructions users interactively enter at a terminal. Each control statement is usually processed before another one is entered.

Executive (EXEC) (Unisys) A software program that controls the system operating environment. The Executive processes user runs, controls ﬁles, manages system resources, and performs input/output operations for users.

Residue security (Unisys) The mechanisms, such as degaussing, used to ensure that sensitive data left in discarded ﬁles and tapes is not accessible to unauthorized users. Security Level (Unisys) The mandatory attributes of a subject or object. With Security Option 1, the security level is the executing clearance level for a subject and the clearance level for an object. Security Option 1 (Unisys) A separately installed feature that enhances the Fundamental Security feature. With Security Option 1, ﬁles are owned and data in ﬁles are protected by mandatory access control and discretionary access control.
