The tax-writing committees of Congress (House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee and Joint Committee on Taxation) are considered to be persons “concerned with” the assessment, collection, enforcement, and prosecution of taxes that are the subject of tax treaties. These tax-writing Congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office (when acting as agent(s) of these com- mittees) should be afforded access to treaty information when necessary to carry out their oversight responsibilities. However, if a Congressional committee request from other than a tax-writing committee involves information disclosed to the IRS by a foreign government pursuant to a tax treaty, such information should not be disclosed to the committee or its agents.
