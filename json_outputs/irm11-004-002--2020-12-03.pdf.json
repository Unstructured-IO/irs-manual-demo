FTA is a non-proﬁt group representing the interests of state tax administrators. The E-List is for personnel, both state tax agencies and IRS, who work with the GLDEP Analysts. GLDEP Analysts at IRS use E-List to alert state tax agency personnel about expected release dates of extracts, to provide updated techni- cal guidance, and to remind them of approaching deadlines. State tax agency personnel use the E-List to explore such questions as how to better use the extracts in compliance programs and whether other state tax agencies have encountered particular difficulties.
