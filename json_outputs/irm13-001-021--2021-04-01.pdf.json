Prior to closing the TAS case, TAS will ensure the taxpayer received a 30-day letter as well as Pub 5, Your Appeal Rights and How To Prepare a Protest If You Don’t Agree. The 30-day letter will afford the taxpayer an opportunity to request an Appeals conference. If the taxpayer decides to go to Appeals, the TAS case should remain open at least until the taxpayer is provided an appointment date and time. Whether the TAS case remains open once the appointment is scheduled will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. For example, if the taxpayer is facing economic harm, the TAS case will remain open to ensure Appeals expedites the case. See IRM 13.1.21.2.2.2, Appeals.",

Closing Contact A contact between the TAS employee assigned the TAS case and the taxpayer or representative where TAS provides a clear, complete, and correct explanation of what was done to resolve the taxpayer’s problem. Individual Issue An individual issue involves resolution of speciﬁc problems taxpayers are experiencing with the IRS. For this purpose, term “individual” includes all types of taxpayers including individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt entities. Primary Core Issue Code (PCIC) Also known as Primary Issue Code (PIC). The Primary Core Issue Code (PCIC) is a three-digit code that deﬁnes the most signiﬁcant issue, policy or process within the IRS that underlies the cause of the taxpayer’s problem. Relief Code A code used to identify the relief provided by TAS based upon the relief requested by the taxpayer when the IRC 7811 determination is “Yes”. In cases involving multiple issues, TAS will code the case based upon the total case resolution, not only the relief initially requested by the taxpayer. Secondary Core Issue Code (SCIC) Also known as Secondary Issue Code (SIC). The Secondary Core Issue Code (SCIC) is a three-digit code used when there are multiple issues to resolve on a case. TAS uses the SCIC to identify multiple issues involved in the case that TAS spent time researching or working to resolve. Systemic Advocacy Man- agement System (SAMS) Taxpayer, practitioners, and IRS and TAS employees use SAMS to submit systemic issues to TAS. Systemic Issue A systemic issue involves the resolution of a problem affecting a signiﬁ- cant number of taxpayers that is rooted in laws, policies or procedures that are ﬂawed in design or implementation. Taxpayer Advocate Manage- ment Information System (TAMIS) TAS uses TAMIS to record, control, and process cases and to analyze the issues that bring taxpayers to TAS Taxpayer Advocate Received Date (TARD) The date TAS received the taxpayer’s inquiry. Taxpayer Assistance Order (TAO) A statutory tool used by TAS to order the IRS to take certain actions, cease certain actions, or refrain from taking certain actions. A TAO can also be issued to require the IRS to expedite consideration of the case; reconsider its determination in the case; or review the case at a higher level in the organization. See IRM 13.1.20, TAS Taxpayer Assistance Order (TAO) Process. Taxpayer Issue Code (TIC) A three-digit code that captures the taxpayer’s perception of the problem or issue.",
