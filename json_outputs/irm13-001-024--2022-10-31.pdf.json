After a stroke, the taxpayer fell behind in estimated tax payments, or after the loss of a job, the taxpayer incurred a ten percent penalty for early withdrawal from an IRA. In such situa- tions, where the taxpayer has been historically compliant except for a one-time catastrophic event, ﬁling of a NFTL will harm the taxpayer’s ability to repay their tax liability and remain compliant in the future. • Undue Harm to the Taxpayer that Hampers Collection. Consider whether the ﬁling of the NFTL will harm the taxpayer’s ﬁnancial viability, thus reducing collection potential, i.e., the ﬁling prevents the taxpayer from obtaining or retaining employment or obtaining the ﬁnancing necessary for a business taxpayer to remain in business. If the ﬁling of the NFTL unduly harms the taxpayer and reduces collection potential, this factor should support a determination to defer ﬁling a NFTL. • Payment before the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED). Will the proposed IA fully pay the taxpayer’s balances owed prior to the expira- tion of the CSED? If the taxpayer can pay in installments before the CSED, this is one factor that supports advocating to defer ﬁling a NFTL. • Existence and Value of the Assets.

When advocating that the IRS accept the offer, note that acceptance will not result in any ﬁnancial gain or unfair advantage to the employer over its com- petitors. Based on communications with the taxpayer, identify the amount of funds intercepted by the third party payer that was intended as payment for the original IRS liability. From the employer’s perspective paying even a small fraction of these funds twice (once to the third party payer, and again to the IRS) is an additional burden on the employer. (",

Will the employer have to lay off some employees? Will the employer have to curtail activities that beneﬁt the community or the local economy? Identify these issues in the TAS recommendation. The IRS considers these factors as compelling public policy factors that favor acceptance. However, these hardship or community elements do not have to be present for TAS to advocate for acceptance of an offer of an amount less than the tax owed if compelling equity factors exist. (",

The Reasonable Cause Assistant (RCA) prompts users to abate penalties via the FTA option by default for qualiﬁed taxpayers. TAS employees will recommend use of the FTA when no other options apply. If using FTA will result in a larger penalty abatement or when the other options would burden the taxpayer due to docu- mentation requirements, the TAS employee should discuss the FTA option with the taxpayer. If the taxpayer decides to pursue the FTA option, TAS will recommend the IRS use FTA to abate the penalty. If a taxpayer requests Failure To Pay (FTP) penalty abatement, but can only support reasonable cause for a short period, TAS employees should use their judgment in these situ- ations to determine if advocating for use of the FTA would be in the best interest of the taxpayer and discuss the various options for relief with the taxpayer. For example, if a taxpayer with a clean compliance history requests FTP penalty abatement due to a two-week illness that overlaps with the payment due date but the tax remained unpaid for one year, then the TAS employee should recommend that the taxpayer seek full abatement based on FTA, not reasonable cause. TAS employees should access the RCA to conﬁrm it will abate the FTP penalty based on FTA.",

Did you ﬁle an extension? Are there circumstances preventing you from ﬁling and paying timely? The taxpayer states they work a lot, did not have time to ﬁle their return or request an extension, and could not pay the tax timely. Accessing the RCA, the TAS employee explores the available categories, but cannot ﬁnd a reason to abate the penalty, and sees no facts or circum- stances that will justify overriding the RCA decision to sustain the penalties. The TAS employee has an honest discussion with the taxpayer, stating TAS can forward the abatement request to the IRS for consideration. However, the circumstances described do not appear to meet the standard of ordinary business care and prudence needed to abate the penalties for reasonable cause. Based on the reason the taxpayer came to TAS, the TAS employee might also say that even though the IRS will most likely deny the abatement request, it still has a responsibility to timely consider and respond to the request. TAS will make sure the IRS does so, and if the IRS denies the abatement request, TAS will make sure the taxpayer receives the proper appeal rights.",
