Both the ESP and SA use web- based systems to receive, track, and approve suggestions or study problems. ESP offers employees the chance to receive monetary awards for that increase efficiency and savings within the Service. The purpose of a SAMS submission is to lessen taxpayer burden or protect taxpayer rights by recommending changes to IRS policy, procedures, and the tax code. SA does not compensate employees for suggesting improvements. The two programs differ in scope. Only IRS employees can make suggestions through the ESP whereas SA allows both IRS employees and external stake- holders to submit issues or problems. SA and the ESP use different criteria. SA has the objective of working for changes that will prevent taxpayer problems; the ESP is designed to provide IRS employees with monetary awards for approved and implemented sugges- tions.",
