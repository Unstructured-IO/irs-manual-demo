    "text": "The Cause and Effect or Fishbone Diagram is used as a method to help show all potential causes simultaneously. It facilitates and structures brainstorming and it helps maintain focus on the speciﬁc problem or issue. The head of the ﬁsh is labeled as the issue or problem. The bones are used to identify major cause categories. The group brainstorms probable causes labeled by branching out of the ﬁshbones, and prioritizes two or three most likely causes for concentration. The Five Why Analysis begins with a statement of the issue. The method then has the Analyst ask “why” until this gets to the root cause. Continue to build on the answers to each “why” until it reaches a logical conclusion for the cause. A good start would be with “Why do we have this issue?",

An upward trend may indicate the need for action even if the absolute numbers are relatively small. A multiple-year look at data might reveal that what appears as an issue (a spike in the data) is not a long term concern. A large increase in a given year might be a “blip” and then things return to “normal” or historical levels.",
