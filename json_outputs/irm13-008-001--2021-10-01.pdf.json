Pre-award reviews are generally conducted in July or August as part of the Program Office’s appli- cation review process. Compliance reviews for current grantees generally are performed in March to conﬁrm grantee’s continued compliance. Federal tax compliance is determined by performing an IDRS check for each grant applicant or grantee to conﬁrm all required federal tax returns have been ﬁled and taxes full-paid or otherwise addressed. Civil Rights compliance reviews are generally conducted in August and September, as part of the Program Office’s application evaluation process: a. Civil Rights Division staff in the IRS’s EDI Office review every LITC grant application for its civil rights reporting requirements, as deﬁned in various Public Laws and an Executive Order. b. After the Program Office reviews and processes all application packages and ensures they are complete, the designated Program Office staff member provides access to the secured LITC shared drive folder where the applications are placed. c. Access is granted to the Civil Rights Division staff member assigned to the review. Upon completion of its review, the Civil Rights Division forwards to the Program Office a preliminary civil rights determination based on the information in the application. d. Where non-compliance or potential non-compliance is identiﬁed, the Op- erations Manager or designee may follow-up with the applicant for additional information or clariﬁcation. If appropriate, any additional infor- mation received from the applicant may be provided to the Civil Rights Division for reconsideration of its determination. e. The Operations Manager will inform the Deputy Director and Technical Advisor of any civil rights issues identiﬁed from the compliance reviews and provide weekly status updates. The Technical Advisor will keep Director advised of any issues so that the Director can determine whether the applicant should be eliminated from consideration or be moved forward to the review and selection phases.
