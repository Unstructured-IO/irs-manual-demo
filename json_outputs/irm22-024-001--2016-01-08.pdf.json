Taxpayer burden is defined as the time or money expended by taxpayers to fulfill their tax compliance responsibilities. The IRS employs Taxpayer Burden Models to estimate taxpayer compliance burden. The models are also used to estimate the burden impact of passed and proposed legislative, policy and administrative changes, as well as to burden reduction proposals based on potential reduction in burden hours out-of-pocket costs. Out-of-pocket costs include the cost of tax preparation software and assistance and other costs such as postage. The latter is especially significant because most taxpayers use some form of tax or software assistance in preparing their federal income tax returns. (",
