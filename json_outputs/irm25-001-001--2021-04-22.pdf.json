    "text": "derstand the requirements of proof. The following table deﬁnes terms commonly used throughout this IRM: Term Deﬁnition Burden of Proof The obligation to offer evidence that a court (judge or jury) could reasonably believe in support of a con- tention. In tax fraud cases, the burden of proof is on the government. CircumstantialEvidence Evidence based on inference and not personal ob- servation. Clear and ConvincingEvidence Evidence showing that the assertion made is highly probable or reasonably certain. This is a greater burden of proof than preponderance of the evidence but less than beyond a reasonable doubt. DirectEvidence Evidence in the form of testimony from a witness who actually saw, heard, or touched the subject of questioning. Direct evidence, which is believed, proves existence of fact in issue without inference or presumption. Evidence Data presented to a judge or jury in proof of the facts in issue and, which may include the testimony of witnesses, records, documents, or objects. Evidence is distinguished from proof, in that, proof is the result or effect of evidence. Fraud Deception by misrepresentation of material facts, or silence when good faith requires expression, which results in material damage to one who relies on it and has the right to rely on it. Simply stated, it is obtaining something of value from someone else through deceit. Inference A logical conclusion from given facts. Preponderance of evidence Evidence that will incline an impartial mind to one side rather than the other so as to remove the cause from the realm of speculation. It does not relate merely to the quantity of evidence. Simply stated, evidence, which is more convincing than the evidence offered in opposition. Presumption(oflaw) A rule of law that a judge or jury will draw a particu- lar inference from a particular fact, or from particular evidence, unless and until the truth of such inference is disproved. Reasonabledoubt A doubt that would cause a prudent person to hesitate before acting in matters of importance to themselves. Such a doubt will leave a juror’s mind uncertain after examination of the evidence.",
