Clear and ConvincingEvidence Evidence showing that the assertion made is highly probable or reasonably certain. This is a greater burden of proof than preponderance of the evidence but less than beyond a reasonable doubt. DirectEvidence Evidence in the form of documents or testimony from a witness who actually saw, heard, or touched the subject of questioning. Direct evidence, which is believed, proves existence of fact in issue without inference or presumption. Evidence Data presented to a judge or jury to prove the facts in issue.

However, depending on the charges alleged in the indictment, the AUSA may or may not be able to include this information in the indictment. If the case does not go to trial, the next opportunity for the cooperating grand jury examiner/revenue officer to ensure civil assessment information required for the collection of taxes is preserved, is during the plea agreement stage. c. Plea Agreement Stage — Even though the cooperating grand jury examiner/revenue officer usually does not participate in this stage, it is important that the cooperating grand jury examiner/revenue officer convey to the AUSA the importance of including speciﬁc civil assessment information and/or information required for the collection of taxes in the plea agreement. Plea negotiations generally result in the defendant pleading guilty to lesser charges. If there was limited disclosure of civil information in the indictment, the absence of speciﬁc civil assessment information and/or information required for the collection of taxes in the plea agreement may result in the civil examiner/revenue officer not having enough non-grand jury information to propose adjustments, make assessments or provide information needed for the collection of taxes. Thus, the defendant may receive a criminal sentence but may not pay any tax and penalties due to lack of information in the public record. If speciﬁc civil assessment information and/or information required for the collection of taxes is not made a matter of public record through the in- dictment or plea agreement, the last opportunity to achieve this objective is during formal sentencing proceedings. d. Formal Sentencing Proceedings Stage — There are many statements and documents entered into the public record during this stage. One of the most important documents entered in the public record is the Govern- ment’s Version of the Facts . This document is often read into the record by the prosecuting attorney. This document usually summarizes what the government would have proven if the case had gone to trial and covers years and/or charges to which the defendant did not plead. Because the Federal Sentencing Guidelines advise that the entire intended loss to the government be disclosed, including years not included in the plea agreement or indictment when sentencing an offender on a tax charge, the cooperating grand jury examiner/revenue officer or special agent should request the AUSA read this information into the record. This is necessary because this information is often sealed as part of the proba- tionary report. Information entered into the record during sentencing proceedings must be relevant to the question of guilt or assist the court in sentencing the defendant. In United States v. Alexander,",
