An IRS employee, who is assigned a case for which there is a POA and will be contact with that POA, has a “business need to know” whether the has been designated as a PDT or CAU. The IRS employee can utilize IDRS ascertain whether the POA has been designated as a PDT or a CAU, just as the IRS employee does for any taxpayer, as long as the IRS employee does not access any of the POA’s other tax information. IDRS Command Code “ENMOD” can be used to determine if the POA has been designated as either a PDT or a CAU. If an IRS employee does not know the POA’s SSN and/or EIN needed to utilize “ENMOD”, he/she can use Command Codes “NAMES” or “NAMEI” to obtain the POA’s SSN - OR - “NAMEE” or “NAMEB” to obtain the POA’s EIN.
