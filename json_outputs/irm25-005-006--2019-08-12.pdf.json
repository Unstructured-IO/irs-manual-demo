To do otherwise would constitute an attempt to disguise the criminal nature of the investigation by having the collection employee issue the summons. See United States v. Tweel, 550 F.2d 297 (5th Cir. 1977) (revenue agent failed to apprise taxpayer of the obvious criminal nature of the investigation and court suppressed all evidence obtained by IRS’s silent misrepresentation). Moreover, such a summons would be unlikely to meet the requirements of a collection summons under IRC 7609(c)(2)(D).",

The Indian Tribal Government (ITG) office in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities (TE/GE) Operating Division coordinates all aspects of tax administra- tion as it impacts Indian tribes. ITG serves as the central point for all IRS contacts with federally recognized Indian tribes. ITG Specialists must stay involved in material interactions between the tribal government and the IRS. Do not serve a summons on a tribal government or a third party for concerning a tribal government without coordinating with ITG. This includes any summons issued by the IRS, including those summonses issued to investigate the trust fund recovery penalty (TFRP) for persons responsible for the unpaid trust fund taxes of a tribal entity. A summons initiated by Criminal Investigation is excepted from this requirement. Due to the unique laws affecting Indian tribes, IRS employees issuing summonses to a tribal entity must ensure that the information being sought is legally obtainable and that the summons can be enforced if necessary. A of the proposed summons should be forwarded to the area ITG manager through the employee’s manager. ITG area managers can be located at Tribal Governments, Contacting ITG at Indian-Tribal-Governments/How-to-Contact-ITG. The area ITG manager will forward the summons to the ITG Field Operations Manager for concurrence the summons. The Field Operations Manager will review the summons and send concurrence via secure E-mail to the originating employee’s manager. The employee’s manager can then approve the summons for issuance.",
