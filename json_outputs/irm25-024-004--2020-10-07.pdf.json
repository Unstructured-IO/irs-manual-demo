Preparer type Deﬁnition Tax Return Preparer Any person who prepares for compensation, or who employs one or more persons to prepare for compensation, all or a sub- stantial portion of any return of tax or any claim for refund of tax under the Internal Revenue Code. Signing Preparer Is the individual tax return preparer who has the primary re- sponsibility for the overall substantive accuracy of the preparation of such return or claim for refund. An individual who prepares a federal tax return for compensation is required to have a Preparer Tax Identiﬁcation Number (PTIN) issued by IRS and must enter it on every tax return prepared for compen- sation along with the preparer name and signature. Any preparer with a PTIN is in the business of preparing tax returns or has held him/herself out as in the business of preparing tax returns. Ghost/Non-Signing Preparer Is any tax return preparer who is not a signing tax return preparer but who prepares, for compensation, all or a substan- tial portion of a return or claim for refund. An individual who prepares a tax return for compensation but does not sign the return as a preparer is a ghost preparer/non-signing preparer. These returns may also be reﬂected as self-prepared.
