Thus, to the extent possible and practical, TAS will transmit OARs, with scanned attachments, via encrypted email.

Otherwise, OARS and tachments will be ee-faxed unless original documents are needed by W&I or attachments are too voluminous or ee-faxing would cause documents to be illegible. When original documentation is required by W&I, forward it by next day or regular delivery service. However, the document(s) will not be until routing is conﬁrmed with a secure email, phone call, or ee-fax. When sending OARs with scanned attachments via encrypted email, TAS employees will be sensitive about the size of the ﬁles sent with the OAR, large ﬁles can cause problems with the e-OAR mailbox. If a W&I Business Unit Liaison identiﬁes a ﬁle that is too large, they will contact the TAS employee to discuss the best way to send the information necessary to resolve the issue to W&I. TAS employees should only send information necessary to resolve the issue on the OAR. The W&I Business Unit will consider whether the size of the e-OAR mailbox needs to be expanded attachment size issues are frequent. If unsure of the correct routing of an OAR, the TAS employee will contact the TAS Liaison or his or her manager in the co-located office.
