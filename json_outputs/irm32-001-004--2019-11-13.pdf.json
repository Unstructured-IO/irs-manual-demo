In general, RAL amounts are capped by the amount of the refund claimed on a tax return. Therefore, a preparer who inappropriately inﬂates the amount of a refund is able, directly or indirectly through arrangement with a RAL provider, to collect a higher fee. Additionally, a signiﬁcant number of RALs are made to taxpayers who claim the earned income tax credit (EITC). The Treasury Department and the IRS are concerned that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of selling a RAL to a taxpayer can create an incentive for the preparer to not fully comply with due diligence requirements designed to ensure the accuracy of EITC claims.

On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court in Oberge- fell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015), held that state laws are invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples and that there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character. Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 23, 28.",

Accordingly, these proposed regulations amend the regulations under section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to provide that, for federal tax purposes, the terms spouse, husband, and wife mean an individual lawfully married to another individual, and the term husband and wife means two individuals lawfully married to each other. These deﬁnitions apply regardless of sex.",

For some of these couples, there are beneﬁts to being in a relationship that provides some, but not all, of the protections and responsibilities of marriage. For example, some individuals who were previously married and receive Social Security beneﬁts as a result of their previous marriage may choose to enter into a civil union or registered domestic partnership (instead of a marriage) so that they do not lose their Social Security beneﬁts. More generally, the rates at which some couples’ income is taxed may increase if they are considered married and thus required to ﬁle a married-ﬁling-separately or married-ﬁling-jointly federal income tax return. Treating couples in civil unions and registered domestic partnerships the same as married couples who are in a relationship denominated as marriage under state law could undermine the expectations certain couples have regarding the scope of their relationship. Further, no provision of the Code indicates that Congress intended to recognize as marriages civil unions, registered domestic partnerships, or similar relation- ships. Accordingly, the IRS will not treat civil unions, registered domestic partnerships, or other similar relationships as marriages for federal tax purposes.",

CMS will provide loans and repayable grants (collectively, loans) to organizations applying to become QNHIIs, to help cover start-up costs and meet any solvency requirements in States in which the organization is licensed to issue qualiﬁed health plans. A Funding Opportunity Announcement for the CO-OP program (CFDA Number 93.545), published by CMS on July 28, 2011 (and amended on September 16, 2011), provides that for each loan the appropriate CMS official will issue a Notice of Award and Loan Agreement to the QNHII. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer of the QNHII, or an officer of the QNHII’s Board of Directors, must sign and return the Loan Agreement to CMS.

Second, no part of the QNHII’s net earnings may inure to the beneﬁt of any private shareholder or individual, except to the extent permitted by section 1322(c)(4) of the Affordable Care Act (which requires that any proﬁts be used to lower premiums, to improve beneﬁts, or for other programs intended to improve the quality of health care delivered to the organization’s members). Third, no substantial part of the QNHII’s activities may consist of carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempt- ing, to inﬂuence legislation.

These regulations provide guidance regarding the determination of discharge of indebtedness income of a partnership that transfers a partnership interest to a creditor in satisfaction of the partnership’s indebtedness. The ﬁnal regulations also address the application of section 721 to a contribution of a partnership’s recourse or nonrecourse indebtedness by a creditor to the part- nership in exchange for a capital or proﬁts interest in the partnership. Moreover, the ﬁnal regulations address how a partnership’s discharge of indebtedness income is allocated as a minimum gain chargeback under section 704. The regulations affect partnerships and their partners.",

C agrees to transfer to AB partnership the $1,000 indebtedness in a debt-for-equity exchange for a debt-for-equity interest in AB part- nership. The liquidation value of C’s debt-for-equity interest is $700, which is the amount of cash that C would receive with respect to that interest if, immediately after the debt-for-equity exchange, AB partnership sold all of its assets for cash equal to the fair market value of those assets and then liquidated. Each of the requirements of the liquidation value safe harbor described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is satisﬁed.",
