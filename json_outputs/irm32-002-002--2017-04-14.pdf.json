For example, in the excise tax area, a letter ruling to one company that a product line is nontaxable would give that company a major competitive advantage over other entities producing the same product.

An issue may qualify for this if it will have a signiﬁcant impact upon revenue. It includes the publication of issues derived from letter rulings and technical advice. d. Invalid Tax Transactions. An issue may qualify under this criterion if it includes anticipating invalid tax shelters and tax schemes and taking prompt action to prevent proliferation of these transactions, rather than waiting to deal with them at a later time in the return examination e.
