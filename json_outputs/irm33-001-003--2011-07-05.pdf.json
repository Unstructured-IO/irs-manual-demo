Thus, an advisory or in- structional document that the National Office of Chief Counsel provides National Office program executives is not CCA. Also, suit letters to, and subsequent correspondence with, the Department of Justice, appeal or certiorari recommendation letters are not CCA. c. Informal advice provided by a National Office professional is not CCA. In the case of e-mail responses to questions from the Field, if the response involves less than two hours of research and preparation, such that a file is not opened, then the e-mail is considered informal advice and is CCA. Conversely, if the time expended in researching and preparing an e-mail response consumes two or more hours, then the e-mail is not informal advice and may be CCA if it meets the definition. The two-hour business rule is the touchstone for determining, for business reasons, whether advice is considered “informal” or “formal.” The Office of Chief Counsel follows this business rule as to what is informal advice of the manner of delivery of the advice. d. While legal advice prepared by the Field and reviewed in the National Office are not, technically, CCA because they are not written or issued by a National Office component, they are released to the public. Also, the formal response of the National Office may be CCA, depending on the nature of that response. If only a telephone contact sheet is prepared because there are no controversies or changes to the field advisory, the contact sheet is not CCA. If changes or more formal advice is needed, National Office response is CCA. e. A proposed Notice of Deficiency or proposed defense letter that has marked up or edited by an Associate office attorney and returned to the Field Counsel attorney or Service employee is not CCA. Also, the actual Notice of Deficiency issued to the taxpayer or the defense letter sent to the Department of Justice is not CCA. f. The memorandum sent by an Associate office to the local Service office with a Technical Advice that offers additional information, such as case development, litigating hazards, or settlement parameters, is CCA. Thus, both taxpayer identifying information and any privileged information must be redacted before it is released. Please note that this memorandum should not repeat the analysis of the issue addressed in the Technical Advice, including the recitation of, and the response to, arguments not adopted by the Technical Advice. g. Legal advice issued by the National Office and distributed to Field employees in writing is generally CCA regardless of the form or title of writing. h. A transmittal memorandum that notifies a local Service office that the ac- companying incoming request for PLR, or similar document (e.g., of Accounting Method, Change of Accounting Period, Closing Agreement) has been withdrawn by the taxpayer and offering to provide assistance is not CCA. Such a transmittal memorandum should not include legal (including the reasons as to why the Service may have tentatively been adverse to the PLR request). Rather, any legal advice issued to the local office, whether issued at the time of withdrawal or subsequently, should provided in a separate memorandum and is CCA. i.
