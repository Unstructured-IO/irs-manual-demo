When the responsible attorney receives this request, the responsible attorney should promptly contact the assigned DOJ attorney in order to come to agreement regarding the scope of preservation and the steps needed to identify, preserve, and collect relevant evidence. This agreement should also cover whether the litigation hold procedures described in this subsection should be followed in the case, and, if so, the custodians to whom a litigation hold should be issued, the types of evidence requiring preservation, and the process that should be followed to ensure preservation. The agreement with DOJ on each of these matters should be documented and noted in the legal ﬁle and conﬁrmed by incorporation into a letter sent to DOJ (typically, the defense letter).

These cases may not require additional steps to preserve evidence if all evidence relevant to the FOIA request has already been preserved during the processing of the FOIA request at the administrative level. However, in considering the appropri- ate steps for preservation for the docketed FOIA case, the responsible should consider the need to preserve certain documents other than those documents sought in the FOIA request, as, for example, where the must defend the adequacy of its search. In all FOIA cases, the responsible attorney should discuss with the attorney’s reviewer and the DOJ attorney the necessity of a litigation hold under these procedures and document all preser- vation efforts in the legal ﬁle. When a litigation hold in a docketed FOIA case requires additional preservation beyond that done at the administrative level, the responsible attorney would typically issue litigation holds to disclosure spe- cialists and any other custodians who may have been involved with the handling of the FOIA request.

Additionally, once the responsible attorney issues an litigation hold notice, custodians may suggest additional custodians to whom the litigation hold notice should be sent. The responsible attorney should discuss this search with the attorney’s manager to ensure the responsible attorney identiﬁes all potential custodians.

Where a custodian is an outside contractor (e.g., economist, industry expert, etc.), the responsible attorney should promptly request that contractor self-collect all relevant evidence, including ESI, and promptly produce it to the responsible attorney for preservation. When a custodian is employee of another Federal agency (including other components of the De- partment of Treasury), the responsible attorney should not directly issue a litigation hold to such custodian, but should discuss and coordinate preserva- tion requests with the other agency’s General Counsel’s office. In DOJ cases, the assigned DOJ attorneys will ordinarily coordinate with other agencies. Liti- gation holds issued to employees of other Federal agencies should not be entered into the Litigation Hold Database, but must be fully documented in the official legal ﬁle, including all communications with agency General Counsel offices.

The amount and type of tax in the suit as well as the taxable periods should be stated at the beginning of the memorandum, in the ﬁrst paragraph. The scope of the supplemental investigation is spelled out in the memorandum. If, however, DOJ in its letter the supplemental investigation describes the desired investigation in cient detail, the memorandum may merely refer to the DOJ letter and request compliance. In suits ﬁled in district courts, where the plaintiff is represented by counsel, the memorandum should advise the revenue agent to approach the plaintiff only after prior arrangements have been made with the U.S. Attorney and only through the plaintiff’s counsel. revenue agent may approach persons other than the plaintiff without notiﬁcation to opposing counsel or the U.S. Attorney. In Court of Claims cases, where the plaintiff is represented by counsel, the plaintiff should be approached only through the plaintiff’s counsel; as with court cases, persons other than the plaintiff may be approached without prior contact with opposing counsel. Always provide the name and telephone number of the attorney initiating the request. Questions can then be directed by telephone to him or her without the need of written correspondence, which might delay the investigation. c. Signature. The memorandum is usually prepared for the name of Area Counsel. Subject to local rules, attorneys who have been with Chief Counsel for one year or more are authorized to sign the memorandum a byline. d. Enclosures. Field Counsel should decide what parts of the ﬁle should accompany the supplemental investigation request. Only the portion of the ﬁle necessary for the agent to complete the investigation should be sent.
