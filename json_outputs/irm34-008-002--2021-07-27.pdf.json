Furthermore, as with defense letters, only one letter is prepared with respect to related cases which contain common issues. The format of a settlement letter involving multiple issues and/or multiple parties will not be different from a regular settlement letter with the exception that each issue, to the extent it is separable from the other issues, is discussed separately and separate conclusions are reached as to the appropriateness of the settlement as to each issue or party.
