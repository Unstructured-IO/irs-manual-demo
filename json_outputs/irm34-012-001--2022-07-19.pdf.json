No. The prohibition against requesting a taxpayer to waive the taxpayer’s right to bring a civil action applies unless the taxpayer waives the right “knowingly and voluntarily,” or unless the taxpayer is represented by an attorney or other federally authorized tax practitioner and the request is made in the presence of the practitioner or is made to the practitioner in writing. The ﬁrst exception would presumptively be met if an unrepresented taxpayer initiated the discussion regarding the waiver of rights and the Government employee could assess that the taxpayer made the waiver knowingly and voluntarily. If the unrepresented taxpayer did not initiate the dis- cussion, a Government employee would risk a violation of the section by raising the subject in any way reasonably construed as a request for waiver. The propriety of the Government employee’s conduct does not hinge on whether the taxpayer actually waives any right to bring suit. Even if an unrepresented taxpayer decides against a waiver suggested by a Counsel employee, the employee could be found to have violated the provision, since the prohibition applies to making a request (not a successful request). Because of these difficul- ties, Counsel’s policy is that it will not propose to an unrepresented taxpayer a waiver of the taxpayer’s right to bring a civil action as covered by IRC 3468.",

The restrictions of IRC 3468 pertain to requesting a taxpayer to waive “a right to bring a civil action . . . for any action taken in connection with the internal revenue laws.”Legislative history suggests that the provision was enacted to prevent the agency and its employees from taking advantage of taxpayers by conditioning reso- lution of a disputed tax matter on a waiver of right to sue the agency over actions or injuries argued to be sustained though improper assessment or enforcement action taken under the internal revenue laws. While the quoted expression can be expected to include actions beyond those taken “under authority of the Internal Revenue Code,” given the history of the provision, it is likely that the covered actions were only intended to include actions taken on or with respect to a tax matter. It is unlikely that the prohibition would be applied to waivers of right to bring suit over actions taken by the agency in connection with general governmental activities (e.g., internal labor matters, government contract matters, FOIA disputes), unless those activities were somehow intertwined with a tax case or cases.

The taxpayer won the lawsuit in whole or in part, causing the court to enter a judgment against the Government in the case. The Department of Justice has advised this office that the Solicitor General has decided not to appeal from the judgment (or from that portion of the judgment adverse to the Government). This office recommends payment of the judgment in the amount of [Dollar Amount of Judgment] for [Tax Year(s)], which is veriﬁed by the recomputation that is attached hereto.

The parties apply search criteria such as keywords, dates, custodi- ans, and document types to a sample of documents and utilize programs to recognize patterns of relevance and identify relevant documents. The parties then further review the identiﬁed relevant documents, instead of the entire universe of documents, for issues such as privilege and relevance. See Dynamo Holdings Ltd. Partnership v.
