Quite frequently, the caption in a bankruptcy case itself will be misstated. For example, if a case is styled “John Jones and the J. Jones Corp.” or “The J. Jones Corp., John Jones, it is critical to determine whether both John Jones (the individual) and J. have ﬁled for bankruptcy or whether only the corporation has ﬁled. Similarly, the caption involving a parent and subsidiaries may be erroneously stated in the bankruptcy court pleadings.

A Munro stipulation may be used (at the discretion of the attorney) to in- clude in the deﬁciency computation before the court carryovers/ carrybacks of net losses from other taxable years which include unresolved partnership losses, but only if all nonpartnership items have been resolved for the years generating the carryover/carryback losses. The Munro stipulation does not allow the Service to assess changes to carryover/carryback amounts attributable to the subsequent resolution of nonpartnership items for other years. Consequently, the parties must re- solve the nonpartnership items for a year generating the carryover/ carryback amount before the Munro stipulation can be used to include in the deﬁciency computation unresolved partnership items originating from that same year. Failure of the petitioner to resolve the portion of the net losses from other years attributable to nonpartnership items forecloses the use of the Munro stipulation for these other years. e.
