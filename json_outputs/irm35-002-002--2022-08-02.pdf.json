As a general rule, the amount of taxes in dispute as alleged in the petition should be the amount of taxes of the kind and for the years deter- mined in the statutory notice (and which are placed in controversy in the petition) plus any increased deﬁciency or liability claimed in the answer. If not all of the adjustments in the statutory notice are placed in controversy in the petition, it is advisable in the answer to show the court the amount of the deﬁ- ciency and penalty as determined in the statutory notice, and the fact that not all of said deﬁciency and penalty are in dispute. This is necessary since the court’s decision must determine the full deﬁciency, or full liability in transferee cases, even though part of such deﬁciency is not contested. If the petitioner claims an overpayment of tax, an admission should be made that such overpayment is in dispute, but the correctness of the amount claimed should be denied. The reason for this is that it is difficult to determine without a re- computation whether the amount claimed as an overpayment by the petitioner is correct even if the issue will be decided in petitioner’s favor.

If the court should hold as to noncommu- nity income that a joint return was not in fact ﬁled, the court should determine the entire deﬁciency against the party ﬁling the return. A different problem exists with respect to community income since, if the court should hold that a joint return was not in fact ﬁled, only half of the community income would be taxable to the spouse ﬁling the return. In such instances a question may arise as to the validity of the statutory notice as to the spouse who was not a party to the return and whether under such circumstance a new statutory notice against such party may be issued. Thus, for protective purposes there should be alleged in the answer, in the alternative, that if the court should hold that joint returns were not in fact ﬁled, separate deﬁciencies should be determined against each spouse, and a claim should be made, in the alternative, for a separate deﬁciency against the spouse who denies ﬁling a joint return based on half of the community income. Care should be exercised in disposition of the case so that the court does not tax one spouse with only half of the community income and determines no deﬁciency as to the other spouse. (",

Whichever method is used, it has one purpose the determination of the correct taxable income. In appropriate cases two methods may be used in determining the correct taxable income; however, method should be pleaded as the primary position of the respondent, and the other as the alternative. The alternative method will be reached by the court only in the event it fails to sustain the respondent on the primary method. In this event the court will decide which is the proper method of computation and determine the correct taxable income under that method.

Once the respondent has established that a portion of the underpayment is due to fraud, the entire underpayment is presumed to be attributable to fraud unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption by presenting evidence that some part of the underpayment is not attributable to fraud.

The form and substance will, of necessity, depend upon the peculiar facts of each case. Ordinarily, the determination of the correct taxable income is based upon the use of several methods of determining taxable income; i.e., speciﬁc items, bank deposit method, or the net worth and expenditures method. The speciﬁc items method is based upon direct evidence pertaining to speciﬁc items of omitted or incorrectly reported income or claimed deductions which are unal- lowable, in whole or in part. On the other hand, the bank deposit method or the net worth and expenditures method involves proof of the correct taxable income by indirect or circumstantial evidence which establishes, without reference to speciﬁc items of income or deductions, that the correct taxable income exceeds that reported. Whichever method is used, it has one purpose ( the determination of the correct taxable income. In appropriate cases two methods may be used in determining the correct taxable income; however, one method should be pleaded as the primary position of the respondent, and the other as the alternative. The alternative method will be reached by the court only in the event it fails to sustain the respondent on the primary method. In this event the court will decide which is the proper method of computation and determine the correct taxable income under that method. In cases in which indirect methods are used, however, speciﬁc items of income included in such computation may be pleaded in support of the fraud penalty to show the requisite fraudulent intent and a taxable source for the income.",

The withheld deposits may be linked to assets purchased or disbursements made. Gross receipts under this method consist of bank deposits plus undeposited receipts. The gross bank deposits must adjusted to eliminate deposits of a non-income nature, such as transfers, deposited, or other such items. Undeposited receipts usually are shown by cash expenditures or accumulations not traceable to withdrawals of funds and not accounted for by undeposited nontaxable receipts.

Normally, the statutory notice does not include transferor as part of the transferee liability. Thus, in unlimited cases the single total amount of the transferee liability will be the total liability of the transferor for taxes and all penalties for all years involved due from the transferor, together with the applicable interest thereon. In limited liability cases the single total transferee liability is the value of the assets transferred.

A taxpayer will be able to challenge a redetermination of value prior to the Service’s issuance of a ﬁnal notice through an administrative appeals process.

The court will usually only grant such motions if respondent has reached an impasse in preparing a stipulation of facts with petitioner who refuses to stipulate to records and third party witnesses will have to travel to a distant city to give testimony to place the matters into evidence. Only at that point in the case development is there a realistic hope that a motion to place of trial will be granted. The court has indicated that, in general, it will change the place of trial over petitioner’s objection only where it appears that the case will in fact have to be tried and that witnesses will necessarily be in- convenienced by having to travel to a distant place of trial.
