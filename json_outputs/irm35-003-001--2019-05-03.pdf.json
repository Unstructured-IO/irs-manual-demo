Therefore, the Tax Court will not, as a general rule, examine the evidence used or the propriety of the Service’s motives or administrative policies or procedures in making the deter- mination of the deﬁciency. There is a limited exception to the rule that the deﬁciency determination making process is not to be scrutinized. In income cases, courts have held that the presumption of correctness will not arise when a petitioner shows that the Service’s determination of deﬁciency is arbitrary and excessive, i.e., without factual foundation or lacking in rational basis. In cases where a petitioner seeks to apply this exception, the petitioner has the burden of producing some reasonable evidence which demonstrates the arbitrary nature of the notice. Once the petitioner produces evidence of arbitrariness of the Service’s determination, the court will determine whether the Service’s assertion of unreported income is supported by evidence linking the petitioner to an income producing activity. The Service must demonstrate the link to the income producing activity to ensure that he is entitled to the beneﬁt of the presumption of correctness. (",

Thus, the cross-motion of respondent (or motion in related case) should speciﬁcally request that it be set for hearing on the same date that peti- tioner’s motion is set for hearing. The ﬁling of such motions will not, within itself, satisfy the requirement for making a response to the petitioner’s motion, and the response should set forth the fact that in addition to objecting to peti- tioner’s motion, the respondent is ﬁling a motion with respect to the same or related case which should be heard at the same time as petitioner’s motion.

The court will be particularly critical of oral motions for continuance made at a calendar to which petitioner or petitioner’s counsel has traveled for the hearing. Respondent’s motions for continuance of hearings at the motions session must be kept to an absolute minimum, and such motions must only be ﬁled under extraordinary circumstances. When they are justiﬁed, the motions should be ﬁled in sufficient time for the court to act upon them and, if granted, to serve a copy of granted motions upon petition- ers, or their counsel, several days in advance of the hearing date.

This is particularly true in situations in which respondent ﬁles a continuance motion just prior to the hearing date and there is not sufficient time for the court to act upon the motion and serve it upon petitioner’s counsel prior to the hearing date, since the petitioner’s counsel may be on the way to Washington, D.C. for the hearing. The court will be particularly critical of oral motions for continuance made at a calendar to which petitioner or petitioner’s counsel has traveled for the hearing. Respondent’s motions for continuance of hearings at the motions session must be kept to an absolute minimum, and such motions must only be ﬁled under extraordinary circumstances. When they are justiﬁed, the motions should be ﬁled in sufficient time for the court to act upon them and, if granted, to serve a copy of granted motions upon petition",
