If, upon review of the amended answer, the Associate office believes it should not be ﬁled, Field Counsel will promptly be notiﬁed so that it can immediately inform petitioner’s counsel of that fact.

The Tax Court has broad discretionary authority to control and seal ﬁles in its possession. The Tax Court may initially conceal information, but the case develops, the public’s interest in access to the case may tually outweigh the factors in favor of sealing or proceeding and the Tax Court may revisit the issue. d. The Tax Court will ﬁrst consider whether allowing the petitioner to pro- ceed anonymously is appropriate, and then consider whether to seal record, because proceeding anonymously (without sealing the record) in large measure preserve the public interest in judicial proceedings. e. Common factors that will weigh in favor of proceeding anonymously in- clude highly sensitive and personal information, physical harm, other niﬁcant harm, social or professional stigma, economic retaliatory harm, being a conﬁdential informant. A mere assertion of annoyance, embar- rassment, or harm to a person’s personal reputation is generally insuffi- cient to overcome the presumption in favor of public access to court records. f.
