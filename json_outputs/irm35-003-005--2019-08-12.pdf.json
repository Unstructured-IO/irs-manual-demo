The use of summary judgment procedures in the district courts has resulted in holdings that a party cannot amend or change positions to rely on another theory after the one used on summary judgment has failed. The reasoning of these cases is that the courts do not want the parties to test legal theories and is a form of judicial estoppel. Since the Tax Court may adopt the same reasoning, each Field attorney should advance all of respondent’s legal arguments in the motion for summary judgment in order not to later be precluded from arguing any of them. If one respondent’s theories is based upon a disputed fact, summary judgment may still be used provided respondent concedes that there is no issue of fact if re- spondent’s legal theory is accepted but at the same time maintains that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts if respondent’s theory is rejected or petitioner’s theory is adopted. Such a procedure is risky unless the is absolutely clear or leaves no doubt that there is a dispute as to the facts. (",
