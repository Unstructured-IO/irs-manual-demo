DOJ should be advised of this action. Because the taxpayer will have been successful in opposing a motion to stay because of the criminal proceedings, the request for discovery or admissions may place the taxpayer in a position of self- incrimination or claiming the Fifth Amendment. If the claim of Fifth Amendment privilege is asserted and sustained by the court, it will provide a basis for a renewed motion to stay because of the pendency of the criminal proceeding. Otherwise, consideration should be given to a motion for sanctions, including dismissal if appropriate, on the issue with respect to which the taxpayer is declining to respond. (",

An attorney should not rely solely upon cross-examination of the petitioner and petitioner’s witnesses to establish the respondent’s case if there is affirmative evidence available which can be presented on behalf of respondent.

In making this determination, it should be remembered that the so-called burden of proof rule does not mean a great deal in our trials since does not take much evidence on behalf of the petitioner to shift to the respon- dent the burden of going forward with the evidence.",

This should be taken into consideration in the evaluation of a settlement or in the determination of whether the case should proceed to trial. An attorney should not rely solely upon cross-examination of the petitioner and petitioner’s witnesses to establish the respondent’s case if there is affirmative evidence available which can be presented on behalf of respondent. Thus, the attorney should develop, to the extent practicable, all affirmative evidence to sustain the Commissioner’s determination, even where petitioner has the burden of proof on the issues. In making this determination, it should be remembered that the so-called burden of proof rule does not mean a great deal in our trials since it does not take much evidence on behalf of the petitioner to shift to the respon- dent the burden of going forward with the evidence.",
