The expansion of “S” case procedures to larger and more complex cases, and the increase in numbers and complexity of pro se mean that these tools may be appropriate in more cases. The overall goal of both the Branerton rule and the court’s discovery rules is the just, speedy, inexpensive determination of every case. The decision to use or not use discovery and requests for admissions in an individual case should be based on that goal.
