Respondent also does not ordinarily subpoena witnesses from federal and state departments agencies, unless the department or agency requests that a subpoena be issued. Respondent must not subpoena a witness who is to testify solely on behalf of the petitioner, even if requested to do so as an accommodation to petitioner. (",

    "text": ") Unless standing procedures exist between Field Counsel and an operating division in the vicinity in which the witness resides, the Field attorney or Associate Area Counsel should contact the Territory Manager for that vicinity informally to arrange a procedure for service of the subpoena. If more than one attorney group is responsible for trials on a specific calendar, the Associate Area Counsel for all those groups should work together to coordi- nate service of subpoenas, to reduce burden on client offices. When the subpoena has been properly authorized, the subpoena package completed, and the procedure for service agreed on, the package should be sent to the personal attention of the Territory Manager (or, in the Territory Manager’s dis- cretion, to the attention of a Team Leader or other delegate), by a means best suited to avoid delay. A transmittal memorandum may cover any number of subpoenas, provided they are all within the same vicinity, because it is possible that one employee will be assigned to serve all of them.

Any which may occur in the service of the subpoena should be anticipated as far advance of the session of the court as practicable in order to allow sufficient time for the service and for the witness to obtain the documents called for. If the attorney has any information indicating possible difficulty in the service or possible attempts to avoid service, this information should be included in the memorandum to the Territory Manager. Any other special instructions Field Counsel wishes communicated to the agent or the witness should also be explained in the transmittal memorandum. Special instructions given the agent should be clear and specific so there is no misunderstanding as to what the agent is to do or avoid. If the Field attorney wants the serving agent to interview the witness, the transmittal memorandum should so state, and be specific in the questions to be asked and the information to be obtained.

Any corporation, partnership, association, or agency, if named as a deponent, designate one or more persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person designated, the matters on which such person will testify. The Field attorney, prior to applying for an order to take the deposition of an organization, should consider securing in advance the identity of a edgeable person within the organization and specify such person in the application. An organization’s designated witness is under a duty to testify as to matters “known or reasonably available” to the organization. In the event designated witness lacks knowledge of the organization’s affairs, the Field attorney should seek an appropriate order directing compliance or imposing sanctions. (",
