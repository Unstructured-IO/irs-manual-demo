    "text": "One of the problems most frequently encountered in handling tax cases involving international aspects is the authentication of foreign business records. Frequently, it is usually easier to obtain copies of the records or excerpts from the records than it is to obtain such copies in admissible form. A typical reason involves the inability of the United States to compel the custodian of the records to provide authenticating testimony. Where authentication of business records is necessary, there are several possible approaches. a. Stipulation. It may be possible to get the opposing party in any litigation to stipulate the authenticity of the records in question. Although obvious, this straight forward approach is sometimes overlooked; on a number of occasions attorneys have gone to inordinate lengths to prove the authen- ticity of documents by other means only to have opposing counsel readily agree to stipulate authenticity. b. Voluntary Testimony by the Record Custodian. The custodian of the foreign business records may appear as a witness at trial in this country to give the necessary authenticating testimony.
