As a general rule, when Field is resisting disclosure of ﬁles, any submission to the Court for an in camera inspection should be made pursuant to an agreement with the judge, or at least a statement on the record or in a cover letter, to the effect that the material or information submitted is to be retained in the Court’s ﬁle or to Field Counsel with an order or instruction by the Court as to the or turnover. The reason for this is that the Court should not make a direct closure or turnover to petitioner, even if it decides that disclosure or turnover proper.
