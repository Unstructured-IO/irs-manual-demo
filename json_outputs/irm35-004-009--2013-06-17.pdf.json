    "text": ") The judge or special trial judge to whom the case has been assigned for trial, will often conduct chambers conferences or telephone conference calls in which discovery schedules, stipulation difficulties, the parties’ position on the issues, and other pretrial issues are discussed. Occasionally the parties’ lection of facts or issues agreed upon differs from that of the trial judge or each other. Since there is no transcript, there is often very little the field attorney can do to counter the judge’s or opposing counsel’s contrary memories. In these instances, the field attorney should consult with his or her reviewer as to the advisability of memorializing any agreements or lack of agreement for the record. Sound judgment is required in these instances. In general it is better practice to confirm in writing any agreements or conces- sions made by the parties in contacts where no transcript will be prepared. (",
