Any motions to amend the pleadings to raise any new issues by petitioner at any time during trial should be opposed if prejudicial to the respondent.

Although inexperienced attorneys should seek training and read literature on the subject of cross-examination, they should also discuss the case and the handling of prospective witnesses with a reviewer or other experienced attorneys. Good cross-examination is not possible without good preparation, including a complete mastery of the facts. While it is usually not possible to prepare speciﬁc questions to be asked on cross-examination, an outline of the matters to be covered should always be made. Good cross-examination is not possible unless the attorney has paid close attention to the direct examination and made notes of areas to be covered. Two general rules to keep in mind for cross-examination are to phrase the questions narrowly to require speciﬁc answers, and to ask the questions in an order which prevents the witness from anticipating crucial questions. Never ask questions on cross-examination to which the answers Chief Counsel Directives Manual Cat. No.",
