The attorney cannot assume that merely because respondent’s requested ﬁndings and arguments are contrary to or incompatible with petitioner’s requested ﬁndings and arguments, respondent’s original brief has answered the petition- er’s brief. The inconsistencies between petitioner’s and respondent’s ﬁndings and arguments should be speciﬁcally handled in the answering brief. The answering brief should also make clear to the court that respondent is not abandoning or conceding any issues. This can be done in two ways: by ad- dressing each issue in the answering brief or by including a disclaimer. The disclaimer should state, for example, that failure to address issues covered in the opening brief does not constitute a concession or abandonment of those issues, that the answering brief is conﬁned to matters not previously or requiring clariﬁcation, and that the opening brief adequately covers the relevant factual and legal arguments for the issues not discussed.

These exceptions will be rare, and any doubt should be resolved by Field Counsel in favor of ﬁling an answering brief. No speciﬁc guidelines can be laid down that will be in all cases. An answering brief certainly should be ﬁled in instances in which the parties are not in accord in their requested ﬁndings of fact. In this instance the court should be advised as to those requested ﬁndings of the petitioner with which we are in accord and as to those requested ﬁndings with which we are not in accord. The reasons for the disagreement should be stated. An answering brief should also be ﬁled in instances in which petitioner’s arguments are based upon points, facts, statutory provisions, or case law that have not been fully and completely covered in respondent’s original brief. This is a troublesome area, and while respondent’s original brief may have to some extent an argument dealt with more fully in petitioner’s brief, it is necessary, or at least desirable, to enlarge upon such arguments, without un- necessary duplication, in an answering brief. It should never be assumed that petitioner’s argument is facetious or lacks substance; such factors should be respectfully and in a proper manner pointed out to the court in an answering brief. Furthermore, it must be kept in mind that some judges of the court spe- ciﬁcally require the ﬁling by the parties of answering briefs; these must be strictly complied with in all instances. There are other judges who do not speciﬁcally request the parties to ﬁle an answering brief. Judges may, Chief Counsel Directives Manual",
