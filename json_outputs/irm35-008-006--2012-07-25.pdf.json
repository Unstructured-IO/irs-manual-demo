An example would be when Appeals properly rejected an offer-in-compromise but after the notice of determination was issued the taxpayer experienced a substantial adverse change in circumstances making the offer-in-compromise acceptable.

The acceptance of the offer should not be referred to above the line because the offer was accepted outside of the CDP hearing and the court has no juris- diction in connection with the offer.
