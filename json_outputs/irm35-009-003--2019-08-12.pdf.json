Thus, in a tried case in which neither party will appeal the court’s decision, a motion must be ﬁled with the court for the withdrawal of the exhibits when such exhibits are needed for related cases prior to the expiration of the appeal period. In this instance photocopies or certiﬁed copies may be obtained and oftentimes will suffice. If it is necessary to permanently withdraw such exhibits, the motion should set forth the fact that the case will not be appealed and the reasons for the necessity of permanently withdrawing the exhibits at that time. Whenever possible, such motion should be endorsed “No Objection” by the petitioner.",
