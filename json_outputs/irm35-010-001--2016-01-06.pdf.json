The amount of the taxpayer’s liability pursuant to the Tax decision is less than what the liability would have been under the offer had it been accepted by the Service. Therefore, the taxpayer is entitled to recover reasonable litigation costs pursuant to the qualified rule.”-“The Service’s position was not substantially justified because the Service lacked basis in fact for determining that the taxpayer was liable accumulated earnings tax when it had no facts about the taxpayer’s business plans and did not show whether case was diligently investi- gated.”-“Th",

As explained in the ac- companying footnote, this should not be a statement of the legal issue. Similarly, a statement that the award was ordered by the court or our position was not substantially justified is not sufficient. The following are examples of acceptable statements: - “The taxpayer provided substantiation of his claimed Schedule C expenses to the Service prior to the issuance of the notice of deficiency. Consequently, the statutory notice should not have been issued. Although the issue was ultimately settled after the taxpayer filed a petition in the Court, the taxpayer unnecessarily was forced to incur attorney fees and costs to resolve the matter.” - “The taxpayer submitted a qualified offer that was not accepted by the Service. The amount of the taxpayer’s liability pursuant to the Tax Court’s decision is less than what the liability would have been under the qualified offer had it been accepted by the Service. Therefore, the taxpayer is entitled to recover reasonable litigation costs pursuant to the qualified rule.”-“The Service’s position was not substantially justified because the Service lacked basis in fact for determining that the taxpayer was liable accumulated earnings tax when it had no facts about the taxpayer’s business plans and did not show whether case was diligently investi- gated.”-“Th",
