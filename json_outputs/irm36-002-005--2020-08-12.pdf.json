    "text": ") Our office will normally object to the taxpayer’s motion on the ground that it fails to meet the criteria for interlocutory appeal. If the ﬁeld office believes tax- payer’s motion is not objectionable, a proposed notice of no objection should be forwarded to the Technical Services Support Branch. Because of the ex- traordinary nature of a certiﬁed interlocutory appeal, the ﬁeld office’s notice of no objection must be accompanied by a memorandum explaining the requirements for an interlocutory appeal have been satisﬁed. The Services Support Branch will assign the notice and memorandum to the Associate Chief Counsel office with jurisdiction over the subject matter for review and coordination. After coordination with the Associate Chief Counsel (P&A), the assigned Associate Chief Counsel attorney must also inform the Department of Justice that there is no objection to the taxpayer’s motion. Our office may not acquiesce in the taxpayer’s motion unless the Department of Justice consents. Because that process requires the concurrence of the Solicitor General in the same manner as a Commissioner appeal, it may be necessary to request the Tax Court to grant an extension of time within which to ﬁle a response to the taxpayer’s motion.
