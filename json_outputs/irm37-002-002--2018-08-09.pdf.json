The initial defense letter should conclude with a statement that a full cussion of the law supporting the recommended defenses and any necessary declarations will be furnished later. If an initial defense letter is provided in lieu of a complete defense letter, the attorney should promptly prepare a ﬁnal defense letter setting forth any addi- tional background information, a legal analysis of the issues, and executed declarations to support a dispositive motion, if appropriate. In the course of preparing the defense letter, the attorney should analyze the records that have been withheld to evaluate the arguments supporting denial of the records. To the extent that an exemption has been misapplied, the attorney should bring the record to the attention of a reviewer to determine if release, in whole or in part, is appropriate. In conjunction with preparing the defense letter, the attorney shall prepare larations to support the exemption claims and other defenses as appropriate. Declarations should include the facts necessary to support the Government’s motion for summary judgement or other dispositive motion, e.g., details regarding the processing of the FOIA request and the search for records. larations are to be written for the signature of, or with input from, those with ﬁrsthand knowledge of the facts. Declarations should be detailed and non-conclusory and avoid the use of missible hearsay.

This responsibility may include obtaining additional declarations, furnishing or updating back- ground information, enlarging upon a defense, preparing a court-ordered Vaughn index, answering interrogatories or other discovery, assessing a ment proposal, or assessing a request for attorney fees and court costs.
