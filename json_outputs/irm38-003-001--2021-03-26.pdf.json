Amend. IV. A lack of particularity will render a warrant invalid regardless of whether probable cause has been established. See, e.g., United States v. Bridges, 344 F.3d 1010, 1015 (9th Cir. 2003). In order to satisfy the particularity requirement, the warrant must enable the executing officer to locate and identify the place to be searched and the items to be seized “with reasonable effort” and “to avoid mistakenly searching the wrong places or seizing the wrong items.” Steele v. United States, 267 U.S. 498, 503 (1925). Further, the warrant must clearly limit the au- thorization to search to “the speciﬁc areas and things for which there is probable cause to search.” Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987). The Supreme Court has made clear that the Fourth Amendment prohibits “open-ended” or “general” warrants. See, e.g., Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 220 (1981); Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 492 (1976) (“The problem to be avoided is ‘not that of intrusion per se, but of a general, exploratory rummaging in a person’s belongings.’”) (citation omitted).

The panel further held that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply because the government did not establish it acted in good faith. On rehearing en banc, the Second Circuit reversed the panel’s decision, holding the good-faith exception to suppression applied in this case.

The court also recognized, however, that the nature of digital storage makes it unfeasible to extract and segregate responsive from non-responsive data. In balancing these two competing interests, the Second Circuit cautioned the government that while the description of the items to be seized in electronic searches need not be perfect to meet the particularity requirement, the government must acquire and include all descriptive facts which a reasonable investigation could be expected to cover.",
