If it is determined that one or more protest grounds have merit and there is no viable defense, in lieu of ﬁling an Agency Report, a notice of correc- tive action can be ﬁled which will normally result in GAO dismissing the protest as moot. The notice of corrective action must be ﬁled before the Agency Report is due because otherwise the Agency will be responsible for paying the protestor attorney’s fees incurred in pursuing the protest. h. GAO decisions are almost always decided solely on the basis of the submitted record. In the rare case where GAO determines a hearing is necessary, it will be held at the GAO headquarters in Washington D.C. GAO has no set procedures for holding a hearing. It will normally conduct a prehearing conference to decide what issues will be addressed at the hearing, to identify the witnesses it wants to hear, and to settle proce- dural questions. After the hearing, all parties will be allowed to ﬁle written comments on the hearing. i. In the event GAO does hold a hearing, the parties will be expected to obtain a court reporter and provide GAO a copy of the transcript. The PCTL attorney should coordinate with the protestor’s counsel as to which party will be responsible for retaining the court reporter, and then coordi- nate with the Procurement Officer for them to either issue a contract for court reporter services or arrange to pay the court reporter obtained by the protestor for any needed transcripts.
